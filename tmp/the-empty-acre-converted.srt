00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,718
(eerie music)

2
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,846
- Hello.

3
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:47,814
- Is it on? - Yeah.

4
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,516
- Mr. Future Farmer of America.

5
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,317
- Yes. - And I'll be the future

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,952
Owning My Own Travel Agency of America.

7
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,521
- Yes.

8
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,289
- And we're going to travel everywhere

9
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,024
in America and outside of America.

10
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,459
- How many children-- (static buzzing)

11
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,395
- But we'll wait a while before we have children.

12
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,563
- Okay.

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,798
- So that we can travel and see things.

14
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,166
- Okay, oh good idea. - That's what we'll do.

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,171
- Yeah-- (static buzzing)

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,308
(groaning)

17
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,476
It's exciting.

18
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,314
(static buzzing)

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,453
(eerie music)

20
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:06,759
(static buzzing)

21
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,594
Look at the big guy.

22
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,399
(static buzzing)

23
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,902
(eerie music)

24
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,017
(insect buzzing)

25
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,924
(static buzzing)

26
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,760
(insects buzzing)

27
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,664
(static buzzing)

28
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,769
Hey Beth, keep him in the shade.

29
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,741
(static buzzing) (eerie music)

30
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,320
He's probably getting tired.

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,454
Maybe we should go in.

32
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,289
Hmm?

33
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,358
Let's go inside.

34
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,460
Go ahead and turn it off.

35
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,566
- [Beth] I think he should have a blanket.

36
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,603
- Let's just get him in, my knees are killing me.

37
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,773
(machinery squeaking)

38
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,926
(crickets chirping)

39
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,030
(cows mooing)

40
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,071
(unnerving music)

41
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,987
(cows mooing)

42
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:18,992
(baby crying) (dramatic eerie music)

43
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,449
Okay, it's okay.

44
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,052
Shh.

45
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,387
Come here Michael.

46
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,588
(groaning)

47
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,922
Oh there you go.

48
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,558
How you doing?

49
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,460
You okay?

50
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,432
(unnerving music)

51
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,073
(dog barking)

52
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,983
(door squeaking open)

53
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,328
(howling)

54
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,799
(eerie music)

55
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,355
(gun cocking)

56
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,858
(eerie music)

57
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,213
(gun firing)

58
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,619
God damn coyotes.

59
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,194
(dramatic eerie music)

60
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,054
- Good morning. - Good morning.

61
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,825
How many times you gonna read that?

62
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,260
- It's only my third time.

63
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,163
I poured you some orange juice.

64
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,668
- Can't see how it could be any better after the first.

65
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,538
What's it about again? - Dreams.

66
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,775
- That's too much pulp.

67
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,745
Did you make this? - Yes.

68
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,779
Fresh this morning.

69
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,655
- You know you're just wasting your time reading that junk.

70
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,724
- Well it's my time to waste now isn't it?

71
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,228
- Where's Michael? - He's still sleeping.

72
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,864
I'm gonna wake him up here

73
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,933
in a few minutes and feed him though.

74
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,767
- Okay.

75
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,702
I'm gonna get to work.

76
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,305
- Okay.

77
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,739
Bye.

78
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,776
(birds chirping)

79
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,312
Yes, it's the second one this month

80
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,646
and no one at your office

81
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,482
has been able to give me a straight answer.

82
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,850
(unsettling music)

83
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,518
What about infection?

84
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,452
In another week I may lose my whole herd.

85
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,488
(cows mooing)

86
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,858
Yeah, well your best isn't good enough.

87
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,292
And what about them samples your people

88
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,393
took over a month ago?

89
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,365
Listen, I got a dead patch of land

90
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,667
the size of a god damn football field.

91
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,170
(eerie music)

92
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,253
(flames crackling)

93
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,376
(laid back music)

94
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,810
- Except it was Greg with a shovel.

95
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,045
(laughing)

96
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,813
I thought that was pretty nice of him.

97
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,884
(chattering)

98
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,090
That's the only way I can. - Yeah.

99
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,126
- Here he comes.

100
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,227
- How you doing Jacob?

101
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,963
- I'm alright.

102
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,097
- [Man] How's the wife?

103
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,198
Haven't seen her around here in a while.

104
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,400
- She's fine.

105
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,235
Keeping busy around the homestead.

106
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,670
- What about your boy?

107
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,938
- [Jacob] Michael's doing great.

108
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,872
Getting bigger every day.

109
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,073
(laughing)

110
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,608
- Yeah, they're so full of life at that age.

111
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,144
- A handful, yeah. - How old is he anyway?

112
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,078
- Just six months.

113
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,313
- Wow. - Oh yeah,

114
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,614
they keep you up at night at that age.

115
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,050
- That's for sure. (laughing)

116
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,551
- [Man] Twins, yeah, that's for sure.

117
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,753
- Oh that's right, I forgot. - Yeah.

118
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,555
- Hey listen guys, has anybody seen

119
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,091
anything of Lyle Johnson?

120
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,261
- Not since the Grimshaw wedding a couple weeks ago.

121
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,796
You? - No.

122
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,897
- How about you, Jacob?

123
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,932
He's your neighbor. - No idea.

124
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,602
- Maybe he's at one of those librarian conventions.

125
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,603
(laughing)

126
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,870
- Stacking the books.

127
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,639
- Nah, he's probably just up at the home

128
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,174
in Norfolk seeing Marge.

129
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,775
Wouldn't be too worried about it.

130
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,877
- I'm gonna get a refill.

131
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,350
- He's always got something going on lately.

132
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,418
- [Man] Won't be a refill coming back here to the table.

133
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,886
- Oh that's for sure. - Must be for him.

134
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,321
He's a seller not a buyer.

135
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:26,058
(chattering)

136
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,803
(eerie dramatic music)

137
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,004
(door creaking open)

138
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,610
(engine starting)

139
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,348
- [Jefferson] Whoa.

140
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,650
- Are you okay?

141
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,653
- [Jefferson] Yeah, yeah, no harm done.

142
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,887
- Jefferson I am so sorry.

143
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,988
I didn't even see you.

144
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,724
- So what's the big hurry?

145
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,197
- I have to get home to make dinner

146
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,499
so I was just thinking about everything

147
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,635
and I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.

148
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,904
- That's alright, you just drive careful now.

149
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,738
- I will. - Alright.

150
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:20,940
- I promise.

151
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,943
- And try not to hit anybody. - I won't.

152
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,244
(laughing)

153
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,680
Bye, I'm sorry. - Bye bye.

154
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,449
(dramatic music)

155
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,471
(crickets chirping)

156
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,110
(cows mooing)

157
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,849
(sizzling)

158
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,541
(muffled talking on radio)

159
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,710
(laid back pop music)

160
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,395
(crickets chirping)

161
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,265
(door creaking open)

162
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,266
- Hey. - Hey.

163
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,872
How was your day?

164
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,673
- Busy.

165
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,310
- Is Michael upstairs? - Yeah, he's sleeping.

166
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,979
I think I tuckered him out today.

167
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,881
- Well good.

168
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,988
(unsettling music)

169
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:22,228
(crickets chirping) (unsettling music)

170
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,445
- No Jacob.

171
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,583
No Jacob, not tonight.

172
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,358
No Jacob that's not okay.

173
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,293
- Come on. - No.

174
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,928
Not tonight, just, Jacob no.

175
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,263
- [Jacob] Come on.

176
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,530
- Leave me alone.

177
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,799
Jacob leave me alone.

178
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,436
Leave me alone.

179
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,438
Jacob leave me alone.

180
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,273
Stop it.

181
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,842
God.

182
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,245
- [Jacob] What is wrong with you?

183
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,217
(horse neighing)

184
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,153
(unsettling music)

185
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:30,129
(horse neighing) (unsettling music)

186
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,329
- [Evan] Damn this is a fancy vehicle.

187
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,497
- Well Evan it's the same vehicle

188
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,800
I picked you up in three days ago.

189
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,034
- No.

190
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,369
- Out in front of the store, that's right.

191
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,804
- I'll be damned.

192
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,775
- You alright there buddy?

193
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,177
How're you feeling?

194
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,346
- Oh, I've been better.

195
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,180
(unnerving music)

196
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,515
(screaming)

197
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,953
- Hand me the flashlight.

198
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,989
(car door beeping)

199
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,992
(suspenseful music)

200
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,476
(dramatic eerie music)

201
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,687
(sirens blaring)

202
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,655
(muffled talking on police radio)

203
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,767
- [Beth] Jefferson.

204
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,637
- Honey I think you should go on home.

205
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,771
- Why, what's going on?

206
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,275
- You know Lyle Johnson's been missing for a couple days.

207
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,510
- Yeah.

208
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,711
- Well some of the townspeople came out

209
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,247
looking for him and they found him.

210
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,315
- Oh my god.

211
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,820
(muffled talking on police radio)

212
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,124
- [Jefferson] Yeah, you need to go on back to the house.

213
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,994
(dramatic eerie music)

214
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,363
I'll come by and let you know what's going on okay?

215
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,197
- Okay.

216
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,132
- Go on home Beth.

217
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,172
- [Beth] Jacob I'm not gonna be a prisoner in our home.

218
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,574
- I don't want you running into town

219
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,042
or visiting the neighbors, not without me.

220
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,577
- But Jacob I can leave this house anytime I want to.

221
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,578
- [Jacob] No you can't Beth, especially if you're always

222
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,179
gonna be in an emotional state.

223
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,648
- [Beth] Excuse--

224
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,882
- Listen, I am sorry that you had to see that with Lyle

225
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,717
but you cannot be going into town.

226
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,985
- Jacob I need to live my life.

227
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,253
- [Jacob] Beth you need to stay here.

228
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,288
- I can't just be cooped up in our house.

229
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,222
- [Jacob] Yes you can.

230
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,256
Shopping for you, whatever it is

231
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,190
you need to do I will do it.

232
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,425
- I don't need your help.

233
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,092
- [Jacob] You need to stay in this house.

234
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,728
(phone ringing)

235
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:02,701
- Hello?

236
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,470
- Hey Beth. - Oh, hi Holly.

237
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,507
- [Holly] I heard the news.

238
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,441
How you holding up?

239
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,346
- I'm fine.

240
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,449
I'm just a little bit shook up that's all.

241
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,220
- [Holly] Well, it was probably a heart attack you know?

242
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,357
I mean he was pretty active.

243
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,792
His heart probably just gave up.

244
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,360
- Well I saw Jefferson from the road

245
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,364
and you know I thought I should go

246
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,299
see what was going on, but--

247
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,202
- Okay sweetie just take a deep breath okay?

248
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,172
I mean Lyle wasn't a spring chicken, these things happen.

249
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,542
Listen some of the gals are getting together

250
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,445
for drinks this afternoon and I think you should stop by.

251
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,446
- [Beth] I don't know.

252
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,214
I have Michael.

253
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,183
- [Holly] Well that's okay, just bring him.

254
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,785
I don't want you staying inside the house all day.

255
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:54,853
- [Beth] You're right.

256
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,423
- [Holly] I know I am and god forbid

257
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,559
you get to know any of the ladies.

258
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,394
They've been wanting to see Michael for months.

259
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,503
- Thanks.

260
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,975
Evan.

261
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,211
- Jefferson.

262
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,046
- [Jefferson] Malcolm.

263
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,615
- Well?

264
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,652
- Well what?

265
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,254
- [Evan] Do you know what happened yet?

266
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,391
- No, I don't think we'll know for a couple days.

267
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,226
I think it was natural causes.

268
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,228
- Natural causes?

269
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,731
- Lyle had more energy than most men half his age.

270
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,135
- Yeah.

271
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,309
- [Woman] I wonder what this little one will do some day.

272
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,577
- He's gonna go fast too. - Yeah.

273
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,379
- About when he's 18 he'll be gone.

274
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,481
- [Woman] Well I worry about the schools here though.

275
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,016
- [Woman] Right.

276
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,484
- [Woman] We have to hold on to him as long as we can.

277
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,921
- Uh-huh, yeah he's anxious to take on moving.

278
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,289
- You know it's neat to be around

279
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,525
a little baby like this 'cause you forget.

280
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,193
- Oh it goes-- - So fast.

281
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,928
- That's Michael. - Michael.

282
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,365
- And Michael is talking to us.

283
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:18,370
- [Woman] I remember when David started school.

284
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,839
It just seemed like his whole life started and,

285
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,642
just before you knew it he was ready to--

286
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,912
- Yeah, I'm afraid so. (chattering)

287
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,380
- [Woman] Before you know it he'll be gone.

288
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,681
- [Woman] I know, with all the other kids,

289
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,149
they'll all be gone. - Right.

290
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,185
- [Holly] I wish you would just try to have a good time.

291
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,386
- [Beth] I know.

292
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,088
- I know they're not the most exciting group.

293
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,522
- I'm sorry.

294
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,359
I just still feel kind of uncomfortable around everybody.

295
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,329
I mean I only know Carol and Jody.

296
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,797
- And me. - Well besides you.

297
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,100
- Oh thank you. - Oh thank you.

298
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,270
I don't know.

299
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,111
Why didn't you and Bill ever have any kids?

300
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,812
- Why do you ask?

301
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,080
- Oh I'm sorry.

302
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,348
You don't have to answer that question.

303
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,182
- No, it's okay.

304
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,551
(sighing)

305
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,286
We were trying and that was the plan

306
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:14,059
and then Bill got sick so I have a dog.

307
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,596
I guess that's like having a baby you know

308
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,830
except you don't have to worry about

309
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,767
them growing up or leaving town.

310
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,569
- I wish I could leave town.

311
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:26,872
I hate it here.

312
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:28,874
- You're just upset.

313
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,577
God I've lived here my whole life.

314
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,545
I actually like it.

315
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,314
I'm gonna stay.

316
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,483
- Yeah.

317
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,685
Well I better get going.

318
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,021
I have to go to Norfolk before suppertime.

319
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,656
- Your mom, how's she doing?

320
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:45,991
- She's okay. - Yeah?

321
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,828
- She's not remembering things very well.

322
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,065
- Hey, okay, how about this,

323
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,902
you go see your mom and I'll watch Michael for you?

324
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,069
- Really? - Yeah.

325
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,438
He'll be fine.

326
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,107
Half the women here are grandmothers.

327
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,943
- Oh I don't know. - Go.

328
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,411
It'll be easy.

329
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,079
We'll spoil him and I'll take him by your house tonight.

330
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,118
(dramatic music)

331
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:33,805
- Hi Mom.

332
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,410
Sorry I haven't been to see you much lately.

333
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:47,519
Things have been kind of busy.

334
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:55,627
You look good.

335
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,464
You always do.

336
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,503
(muffled talking)

337
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,779
(dramatic music)

338
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,101
- Hey, excuse me.

339
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,335
- Yes?

340
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,603
- I'm sorry I don't normally do this,

341
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,440
but I need a ride to the bus station.

342
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,210
I was wondering could I hitch a ride with you?

343
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,448
- I don't know, I'm kind of in a hurry.

344
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,217
- I'm sorry if you're uncomfortable.

345
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,653
- Oh no it's not that I'm uncomfortable, I just--

346
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,122
- Don't worry I'll-- - Need to get going.

347
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,189
- Find somebody else.

348
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,933
- You know what, it's okay, I can give you a ride.

349
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,534
I'm going that direction anyway.

350
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,971
- It's only a couple miles.

351
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,873
- I'm just parked right over here, so.

352
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,909
- So you're just visiting then?

353
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,078
- Yeah, my mother actually.

354
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:20,912
- How is she?

355
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:27,218
- Well, getting older is just taking its toll.

356
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,054
- Yeah.

357
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,755
Yeah I know what you mean.

358
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,392
- But I get to go home and see my little boy.

359
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,428
- [Man] Wow.

360
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,263
- He is going to be six months.

361
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,631
- Oh really, wow. - Yeah.

362
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,168
It's hard to believe though.

363
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,670
They just, they grow so fast you know?

364
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,874
- Yep, time flies.

365
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,447
- So what brings you to Norfolk?

366
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,284
- I was just visiting my mother too.

367
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,552
- Oh really?

368
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,087
- Yeah, got in on the bus yesterday.

369
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,857
- Well I'm sorry, is she okay?

370
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
- It's hard to tell.

371
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,766
I'd rather not talk about it.

372
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,772
You can just let me off right up here.

373
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,606
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

374
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,443
- You sure? - Oh yeah, yeah I'm sure.

375
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,278
Yeah, this is a good spot right here.

376
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,549
(frogs croaking)

377
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,020
(door closing)

378
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:37,956
- Where have you been?

379
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,959
- I went to Norfolk.

380
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,628
- Why did you leave Michael over at Holly's?

381
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,465
- Holly offered to take care of him for me.

382
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,501
Why, he's okay isn't he?

383
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,136
- He's upstairs asleep.

384
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,807
I thought I said earlier today

385
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:58,009
I didn't want you running around.

386
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,279
(eerie dramatic music)

387
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,911
- This used to be quite a place.

388
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:33,778
- Is everything okay?

389
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,213
He stop crying?

390
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,815
- He's fine.

391
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,717
- You know you were supposed to keep him with you all day.

392
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,521
- Why Jacob, so you could spend

393
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,156
the whole afternoon at Carlson's?

394
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,526
- What's that supposed to mean?

395
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,962
- I think you know what it's supposed to mean.

396
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,164
You've been spending a lot of time there lately.

397
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,534
But let me guess, it's me right?

398
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,471
(unsettling music)

399
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,410
- I'll spend as much time at Carlson's as I want to.

400
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,612
- That's real mature Jacob.

401
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,516
- It's better than being here. (baby crying)

402
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,419
(unsettling music)

403
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:26,431
(baby crying) (unsettling music)

404
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,649
We'll continue this in a moment.

405
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,953
(unsettling music)

406
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:05,703
Beth?

407
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,541
(unsettling music)

408
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,449
(heartbeat thumping)

409
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,887
I looked under clothes.

410
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:23,888
I looked over the perimeter.

411
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,223
Everywhere I could, where is he?

412
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,491
- [Beth] I don't know.

413
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,659
- Where is he? - I don't know!

414
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,894
- Where is he? - I don't know!

415
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,730
(unnerving music)

416
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,409
(muffled shouting)

417
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,578
- Where is he? - I don't know!

418
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,947
- Where is he? - I don't know!

419
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,853
(phone ringing)

420
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,324
- [Holly] Hello?

421
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,061
(unnerving music)

422
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,636
- [Jacob] Michael!

423
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,004
- [Beth] Michael!

424
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,806
- [Jacob] Michael!

425
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,775
- [Beth] Michael!

426
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,243
- [Jacob] Michael!

427
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,881
- [Beth] Michael!

428
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,755
(dramatic music)

429
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,273
(unsettling whooshing)

430
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,009
(dramatic music)

431
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,049
- We haven't found anything.

432
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,119
No sign of a break in.

433
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,189
No sign that Michael got out on his own.

434
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,060
And you say the window was left open last night?

435
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,261
- Yes.

436
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,130
- Yes the window was open.

437
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,966
- And you were both just downstairs?

438
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,634
- Yes we were in the living room.

439
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,370
- Okay.

440
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,575
Now usually when there's a break in

441
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,076
we'd be able to turn up some kind

442
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,979
of evidence, traces, something.

443
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:39,517
Are you sure you haven't seen anything unusual

444
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,552
around the farm the last couple of days?

445
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,454
Anything out of the ordinary at all?

446
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,257
- [Beth] No.

447
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,294
- Alright.

448
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,965
Well we dusted for prints around the crib

449
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,566
and around the windows.

450
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,036
If somebody was up there last night we'll know about it.

451
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,272
Well if this is a kidnapping something's gonna turn up.

452
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,640
- [Man] You want me to call someone in Osage?

453
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,342
- [Jefferson] No, I got that handled.

454
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,278
(unsettling music)

455
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,195
- [Man] You really think that baby

456
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,663
could've come out this far?

457
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,833
- We're just looking for anything suspicious.

458
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,303
Tracks, footprints, anything out of the ordinary.

459
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,572
Just keep looking.

460
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,214
- Why do you keep looking at me like that?

461
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:45,616
- No reason.

462
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,058
- Do you think this is my fault somehow?

463
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,895
Answer me.

464
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,064
(sighing)

465
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:01,833
- No.

466
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,237
I don't think this is your fault.

467
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,339
- Alright.

468
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,749
- Why the insistence on leaving the god damn window open?

469
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,951
- What?

470
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,385
- You know damn well what I'm talking about.

471
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,054
- We always left his window open Jacob.

472
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,822
- Because you insisted on it.

473
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,457
- The room was too hot for the baby, you know that.

474
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,892
- If the window would've been shut and locked

475
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,127
this would've never happened.

476
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,728
- How can you blame me for that?

477
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,466
(door opening)

478
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,736
(eerie dramatic music)

479
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,417
(laid back music)

480
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,185
- Hey Jacob.

481
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,488
- What do you want Evan?

482
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,724
- I just heard about your son.

483
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,925
Anything I can do?

484
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,460
- Any idea who might've took him?

485
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,332
- Well a few nights ago we saw a guy

486
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:18,069
running across the road not too far from your place.

487
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,604
- Did you get a good look at him?

488
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,105
- Not really.

489
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,708
It looked like a man, but it might've been a teenager.

490
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,675
- Who was with you?

491
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,811
- Jefferson.

492
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,980
Yeah, we were going down Country Road C.

493
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,349
He thought it looked like a teenager, you know?

494
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,051
Maybe a kid from one of the field parties or something.

495
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,086
- What night?

496
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,387
- Just this last Saturday.

497
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,224
- It's probably one of those god damn Henderson kids.

498
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,792
- Hey, hey Jacob, it could've been anybody.

499
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,694
You know, I just thought you should know.

500
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,968
- Why didn't you tell me you saw somebody two nights ago?

501
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,436
- What are you talking about?

502
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,639
- You know what I'm talking about, on Road C two nights ago.

503
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,807
- Now Jacob I'm looking into that alright?

504
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,976
- Someone has my son dammit.

505
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:00,645
Now was it one of the Hendersons?

506
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,114
- I'm gonna go see the Henderson boys tonight.

507
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,915
You just need to stay clear of this one Jacob.

508
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,484
I know how your temper can get.

509
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,220
Jacob listen.

510
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,623
I'm turning up leads alright,

511
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,393
but the last thing this town needs is to get into a panic.

512
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,729
People feel safe in this town

513
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,897
and I need to keep it that way.

514
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,033
- If you have a suspect I'm the first one

515
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,267
who should know about it.

516
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,368
I don't want to hear it from Evan.

517
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,202
- Okay, alright.

518
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,773
And as soon as I do you will be the first one I tell.

519
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,041
- I damn well better.

520
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,416
(dramatic eerie music)

521
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,253
(crying)

522
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,232
(vomiting)

523
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,775
(crying)

524
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,289
- [Holly] Have you been home long?

525
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,123
- No.

526
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,460
I've been in town searching.

527
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:28,199
I've been talking to anybody who will listen to me.

528
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,400
Just asking them if they know

529
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,868
anything or if they see anything.

530
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,137
Showing them pictures.

531
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,741
- What about Jefferson, what did he say?

532
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:40,544
- He searched Michael's room, nothing.

533
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,783
What about you?

534
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,554
Have you seen anything strange or out of the ordinary?

535
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,189
A person or anything?

536
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,725
No? - No.

537
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,900
- You know the past few nights

538
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,269
I've been hearing some things out in the field.

539
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,541
- [Holly] Simon's been barking every night.

540
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,176
It's probably just coyotes.

541
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,719
- He blames me.

542
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,586
- Who blames you?

543
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:26,891
- Jacob.

544
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,567
I left Michael's window open.

545
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,837
It's my fault that Michael's gone.

546
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,439
- Don't say that.

547
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,013
- He blames me for having Michael in the first place.

548
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,821
I don't think Jacob ever even wanted children.

549
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,492
At least not with me.

550
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,129
- You know that's not true.

551
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:13,704
(sighing)

552
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,839
- I'm sorry Holly.

553
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,809
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,713
I'm just really tired.

555
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,722
- Your restroom's upstairs right?

556
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,991
- [Beth] Yeah, up the stairs to the left.

557
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,896
(eerie music)

558
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,320
- [Holly] Hey, hey.

559
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,288
- Is everything okay?

560
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,557
- Yeah, everything's fine.

561
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,860
I'm gonna get going so you can get some sleep okay?

562
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,362
You look awful.

563
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:16,267
I mean, not awful, but anyway I should go check on Simon.

564
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,135
- [Holly] Okay.

565
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,370
- Let me know if you hear anything okay?

566
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,471
- Sure. - Okay.

567
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,574
- Give me a hug. - Okay.

568
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,844
(dramatic eerie music)

569
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,420
(phone dialing)

570
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,663
(eerie music)

571
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,736
(pills rattling)

572
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,060
(unsettling music)

573
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,035
(baby crying)

574
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,874
(screeching)

575
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,813
(baby crying)

576
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:40,818
Michael?

577
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,054
(eerie dramatic music)

578
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,725
(baby crying)

579
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:56,467
(panting)

580
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,301
Michael?

581
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:03,507
(baby crying) (unsettling music)

582
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,159
Michael!

583
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,751
(phone ringing)

584
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,153
- [Holly] Hello?

585
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:50,854
- Holly. - Beth.

586
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,590
- [Beth] I heard him Holly.

587
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,292
- Slow down. - Michael.

588
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,095
He's somewhere out in the field.

589
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,663
- [Holly] You heard what?

590
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,433
- Just now, but I can't find him.

591
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,136
I heard him crying the field.

592
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,071
- [Holly] Slow down.

593
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,972
- Dammit, I heard him Holly.

594
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,308
(baby crying)

595
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,676
Michael.

596
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,679
(dial tone humming)

597
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,017
(baby crying)

598
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,008
Jacob I heard him.

599
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,176
I heard him cry.

600
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,411
- [Jacob] What?

601
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,217
(gun cocking)

602
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,488
(hooting)

603
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,567
(distant barking)

604
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,483
(door creaking open)

605
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:30,921
- Where is he?

606
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,657
Did you see him?

607
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,932
- You sure you heard Michael?

608
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,333
- Yes Jacob I heard him.

609
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:46,303
You believe me don't you?

610
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,206
- I'm going to bed.

611
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,908
- Wait Jacob, I heard him.

612
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,444
You think I'm crazy don't you?

613
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:56,647
God.

614
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,585
That's why you want me in this house all day.

615
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,620
Because you're afraid I'm gonna embarrass you or something.

616
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,055
- That's enough.

617
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,124
- [Beth] Well what is it then Jacob, huh?

618
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,960
Are you afraid they might think

619
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,461
your wife's a mental patient?

620
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,163
- Shut your damn mouth.

621
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,200
- Where were you tonight Jacob, huh?

622
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,670
- In town. - I know you were in town.

623
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,972
I saw your car parked at Carlson's.

624
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,207
- [Jacob] Mm-hm.

625
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,441
- You know I really don't think Michael's

626
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,809
going to turn up at the local bar.

627
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,213
- I was asking some of the farmers

628
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,615
if they've heard or seen anything.

629
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:32,449
- And?

630
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,719
- And Jefferson thought he saw somebody suspicious

631
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,221
the other night out on Road C.

632
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,990
Thought it might be one of the Henderson boys, alright?

633
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,692
Satisfied Beth?

634
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,095
- And that took you all night?

635
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,966
Your son is out there somewhere

636
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,767
and you spent the whole night drinking.

637
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,702
- Oh come on.

638
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,403
- I can smell it on you Jacob.

639
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,107
Do you think I enjoy being married to a drunk?

640
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,776
(slap thwacking) Ow.

641
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:04,147
- Now as long as you choose to live in this house

642
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,917
you're gonna watch and remember who you're speaking to.

643
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,354
I'm going to bed.

644
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,957
I suggest you do the same.

645
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,930
(unsettling music)

646
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,403
- It's okay.

647
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,472
God no.

648
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:45,622
I'll do it.

649
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,092
I'll do it.

650
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,963
(unsettling music)

651
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,450
- So where am I taking you?

652
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,820
- It's five or six miles up the road.

653
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,562
- You get in an accident or something?

654
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,332
- Yeah.

655
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,570
(unsettling music)

656
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,744
(laid back music)

657
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,387
(eerie music)

658
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:33,563
(muffled talking on police radio)

659
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,820
- [Jefferson] Well when did she call?

660
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,890
- [Holly] 11 o'clock.

661
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,525
- [Jefferson] And what did she say exactly?

662
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,694
- Well she was really upset and she was crying

663
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,197
and she said she could hear the baby in the field.

664
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,900
- Crying? - Mm-hm.

665
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:14,938
- Where was Jacob? - Not home.

666
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,574
I think he's been spending a lot of time at Carlson's.

667
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,408
- Yeah.

668
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,044
- I mean I'm not trying to cause a problem,

669
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,213
I just, I thought you ought to know.

670
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,882
- [Jefferson] Why did they call

671
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,417
you when Michael disappeared?

672
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,388
- I don't know, I guess Beth and I are kind of close.

673
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,089
I mean she doesn't know very many people.

674
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,626
(dramatic music)

675
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,761
- [Man On Radio] The local police

676
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,663
continue to be puzzled by the events.

677
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,898
It's only a matter of time before the parents

678
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,868
become the prime suspects in the disappearance.

679
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,039
(eerie dramatic music)

680
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,936
- Jefferson's over there right now.

681
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,272
I don't know.

682
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,273
I guess to check up on her.

683
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,043
Yeah, Jacob stayed in town all night.

684
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,779
Well I sorry for him too.

685
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,682
Well he's probably afraid of her.

686
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,752
(laughing)

687
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,854
Okay, I'll keep you posted.

688
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,558
Call me tonight, bye.

689
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,330
- Any news?

690
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,670
- The Henderson boys were in Octavia both nights.

691
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,605
It could've been anybody.

692
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,140
- It's been almost two days.

693
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,942
Nothing's turned up.

694
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,645
(dramatic music)

695
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,625
- [Man] I can't imagine how Jacob must be feeling right now.

696
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,562
- [Man] Yeah, he's a had a run of bad luck, that's for sure.

697
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,532
- [Man] If it were me, I'd cut my losses and hit the road.

698
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,701
- [Man] No you wouldn't and neither is he.

699
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,036
He's not going anywhere.

700
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,572
He's got this place in his blood.

701
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:36,413
(static buzzing) (dramatic music)

702
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:53,730
- [Man] You know I've been hearing

703
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,666
some crazy rumors about town.

704
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,934
- Yeah, like what?

705
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,904
- [Man] Oh just some about Jacob's wife.

706
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:06,843
- [Man] Let me guess, Holly Stevenson is your source.

707
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,883
- [Holly] Mm-hm.

708
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,885
That's interesting.

709
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,224
Do I think she had something to do with Michael?

710
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:23,627
I don't know, maybe.

711
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,230
You know she takes medication.

712
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:31,201
(dramatic music)

Come here buddy.

Come on buddy.

- I saw Sue there. - Sue.

748
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:31,701
Yeah let's go to Bobby's.

749
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:32,635
- I don't want to go to Bobby's.

750
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,870
- Why not?

751
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,104
- Why don't you want to go to Bobby's?

752
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:35,772
- Because Tyler is gonna be there.

753
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,543
(unsettling music)

754
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,011
- Oh right, this is Miller Road right up here.

755
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,713
- [Woman] Oh yeah the Olson property's on that road.

756
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,948
- Yeah, yeah.

757
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:45,748
- Okay, we can go check that out.

758
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,549
- Okay let's do that.

759
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,550
(unnerving music)

760
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,787
(thumping) Oh my god.

761
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,855
- [Man] Hold on, hold on.

762
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,162
Hey.

763
00:59:59,162 --> 00:59:59,996
Hey!

764
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,536
(eerie music)

765
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,276
- [Woman] Dale.

(eerie music)

767
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,340
- [Man On Radio] A bunch of disappearances, not just here,

768
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:48,578
but in surrounding counties very similar in nature.

769
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,414
None of the local authorities seem to be able

770
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,516
to explain the kidnappings.

771
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,286
(eerie music)

01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,376
- Jefferson.

776
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,245
Yeah.

777
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,614
Slow down.

778
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,984
Yeah.

779
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:28,818
Okay.

780
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,223
Yeah, when's the last time you saw her?

781
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,729
Okay.

782
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:41,631
Yeah we're on it.

783
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,400
(dramatic music)

784
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:47,904
- [Man On Radio] For those of you just tuning in

785
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,473
we've been discussing the latest on the missing child,

786
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,375
Michael Nance who was taken from

787
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,944
a local home several days back.

788
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,614
The local police continue to be puzzled by the event.

789
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,383
Beth Nance is with us.

790
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,885
She is the mother of the missing child Michael.

791
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:04,620
- Okay.

792
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:06,889
Please.

793
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,860
Please help us.

794
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:13,830
Or look around.

795
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,234
Even if you could just help us search for him.

796
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,374
If you're out in the fields or anywhere.

797
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,544
I heard him, I heard him.

798
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,583
And he's out there somewhere.

799
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,918
And we can find him, please.

800
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,956
If you're able to help please help.

801
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,729
(dramatic music)

802
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,237
Hey Mom.

803
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:01,477
Can you hear me?

804
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,753
I really need you right now.

805
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,489
(dramatic music)

806
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:41,050
(eerie dramatic music)

807
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:50,793
- Who are you?

808
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:51,794
- Oh I'm sorry.

809
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,299
I'm Beth Nance, I live on the farm just east of yours.

810
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,134
- Have you seen my husband?

811
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,937
He doesn't come here anymore.

812
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,243
- Is this your artwork?

813
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,046
- Why do you care?

814
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:15,518
- [Beth] Is it a field?

815
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,856
- It's our farm.

816
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,462
- [Beth] I like it.

817
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,902
- Never did much work until I came to this hellhole.

818
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,405
Didn't see the point to it.

819
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:37,373
I still don't.

820
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,678
- [Beth] And what's this?

821
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,585
- It's nothing.

822
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,222
- [Beth] Nothing?

823
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,027
- Nothing, that's exactly what it is.

824
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:03,532
The same nothing that's sucking the life out of that town.

825
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,670
There's nothing good to ever come from that town

826
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,605
and there never will be.

827
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,375
It's going to waste away.

828
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,181
Get out.

829
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,383
- Excuse me?

830
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,318
- I said get the hell out of my room.

831
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,319
Nurse!

832
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,520
Get, Nurse, Nurse!

833
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,022
Get.

834
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,758
(dramatic music)

835
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:39,969
(muffled talking on police radio)

836
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,701
- The town went all funny.

837
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:16,505
But people started disappearing.

838
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,345
Clarence Anderson's son, he was the first one.

839
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,949
And then other people would disappear without a trace.

840
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,821
Not just people either, cattle.

841
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,357
Cattle disappeared.

842
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,894
They found old Elmore Cogdell

843
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,299
and Becky Larson, what was left of 'em.

844
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:46,869
They weren't exactly spring chickens

845
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:51,474
but they used to be the liveliest people this side of plat.

846
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,544
The land went all funny too.

847
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:00,649
It started on the old Marshall place.

848
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,785
That's where they found the missing cattle.

849
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,756
Oh hell there ain't nobody left,

850
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,992
but me and a couple of old timers.

851
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,627
They're all gone.

852
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:13,362
- [Jefferson On Phone] So did you learn anything up there?

853
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,697
- [Man On Phone] Well the town's pretty dead.

854
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,465
No families, nothing.

855
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,602
Just a few old timers giving me the same bullshit story.

856
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,204
- [Jefferson On Phone] Alright, head on back to town.

857
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,506
Let's get a patrol car out on Road C.

858
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,676
(eerie music)

859
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:09,385
(muffled talking on police radio)

860
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,361
(eerie music)

861
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,686
(car door opening)

862
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,028
(wind chimes ringing)

863
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:06,041
(knocking on door)

864
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:10,613
- Come on.

865
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,049
No, I won't let her in.

866
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,652
I won't let her in.

867
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,156
(eerie music)

868
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,895
No.

869
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:29,899
Okay.

870
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,636
(eerie music)

871
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,728
Hey, can I help you?

872
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:01,530
- I saw your light on from the road.

873
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,403
I remember you from a couple days ago.

874
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,040
What are you doing here?

875
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,974
- Oh I'm sorry.

876
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,542
I wasn't very upfront that day.

877
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,911
I'm Phillip, I'm Marge and Lyle's son.

878
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:18,814
- I see.

879
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,017
Why didn't you tell me that?

880
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,252
- Well I didn't know you.

881
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,723
And with my father passing and my mother being sick

882
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,425
I just didn't want to trouble you.

883
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,062
See I came to Norfolk to visit my mother.

884
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,131
She didn't even recognize me.

885
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,902
I was gonna leave town that day,

886
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,638
but my father passing so sudden,

887
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:43,973
there's just so much to do.

888
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,709
Hey you live nearby here?

889
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,111
- Yeah I live next door.

890
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,814
I have for a couple of months.

891
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,150
- You want to come in and have a drink?

892
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,687
- No, I need to get back.

893
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,291
My husband's expecting me.

894
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,792
- Oh come on, just for a while.

895
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,862
Get to know the neighbors.

896
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:16,038
- Alright.

897
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,841
(muffled talking on police radio)

898
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,343
(dog barking)

899
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,550
(muffled talking on police radio)

900
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,391
(eerie music)

901
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,940
(dog barking)

902
01:11:53,008 --> 01:11:54,143
- Have a seat.

903
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,423
- Is this Lyle?

904
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:09,558
- Yeah.

905
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,660
Pretty adventurous, huh?

906
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,031
- [Beth] Wow, I didn't know he did all this stuff.

907
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:16,865
- Yeah.

908
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,268
Mom never appreciated it.

909
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:21,804
Always thought he should stay

910
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,372
here and take care of the farm.

911
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,476
It had been in my mother's family for a long time.

912
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,777
Kind of got dumped on him.

913
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:31,980
He never left because of it.

914
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,352
- We only spoke on occasion.

915
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,691
He let me check out library books when he wasn't there.

916
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,362
- I should've made it to his funeral.

917
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,901
I didn't even know he had a son.

918
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,672
- I was adopted when I was three.

919
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,776
Don't remember anything before that.

920
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:05,781
(muffled talking on police radio)

921
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,617
(unsettling music)

922
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:12,788
(muffled talking on police radio)

923
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,725
(unsettling music)

924
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:44,553
Oh.

925
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,857
(water running)

926
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:49,925
Why don't you have some water?

927
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,393
It's all we got.

928
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:52,961
- [Beth] Thank you.

929
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,434
- Something bothering you?

930
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:14,116
- My son, Michael, he was stolen

931
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,586
from my house a few nights ago.

932
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,856
- Stolen, how?

933
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:26,929
- He was just taken from his bedroom.

934
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,269
There were people searching all around the home.

935
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,571
I assumed that you knew.

936
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,439
- I've been in town.

937
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,142
I'm sure the sheriff's been here,

938
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,743
but I've been trying to do some

939
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,512
legal stuff with the house in town.

940
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:46,448
Do you know who did it?

941
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,686
- No.

942
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:53,755
(eerie music)

943
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:58,527
- Well, if there's anything I can do to help let me know.

944
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,218
I've been a little dehydrated lately.

945
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,190
(unsettling music)

946
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,903
(dog barking)

947
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:49,711
- Simon?

948
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:10,065
- I really want to get to know you.

949
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,199
What brought you here?

950
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:13,268
- Here?

951
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:16,538
- Yeah.

952
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:18,640
Why'd you come to this dying little burg?

953
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,945
- Well, I should be getting back.

954
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,415
- It's okay, you don't have to answer

955
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,716
if it makes you uncomfortable.

956
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,255
(sighing)

957
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:41,063
- Jacob and I, my husband, we met a few years back in Osage.

958
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:48,770
I was going to go to college,

959
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,038
but I couldn't afford it.

960
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,841
- Where did you want to go?

961
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:55,811
- Anywhere far from here.

962
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,649
I still think about it though.

963
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,088
It's the only thing that's been keeping me going lately.

964
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,125
- You could still go you know?

965
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,128
- I thought I could take some classes,

966
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,497
kind of a home school approach to college,

967
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:22,070
but I didn't do it.

968
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:33,482
And then I got pregnant and then we got married.

969
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,421
And then we found a farm out here that was affordable.

970
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:42,090
And here I am.

971
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:46,661
But it's all different now.

972
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,703
Michael was the only thing that ever kept us together.

973
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,210
He was the only thing that ever made me happy.

974
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:08,950
I thought about leaving here

975
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:13,822
and taking him with me but I can't leave.

976
01:18:19,861 --> 01:18:21,329
But you got away somehow.

977
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:32,407
(unsettling music) (dog barking)

978
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:49,958
- Simon.

979
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:56,198
(dog barking) (unsettling music)

980
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,022
(dramatic music)

981
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:23,825
(dog barking)

982
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,561
(dramatic music)

983
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,030
- [Man] How old did you say he was?

984
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,567
- About seven and half years.

985
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:35,837
- Holly this dog's at least 16 years old.

986
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,672
- That's not possible.

987
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,007
- Well I could do a throat culture

988
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,209
to determine cause of death but I think it'll

989
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:44,780
just come out natural causes or dehydration.

990
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,448
- Dehydration?

991
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,916
- His throat's completely dry.

992
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,654
- That can't be Simon.

993
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,758
(dramatic music)

994
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,262
- Well, what about you?

995
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,230
You haven't talked much about yourself.

996
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,300
- Not much to say.

997
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,470
- [Beth] You've been gone for a while haven't you?

998
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,040
- I suppose.

999
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:12,874
- Well?

1000
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,850
- Nothing much to tell.

1001
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:29,124
I guess you could say I've been living in a dream.

1002
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:32,827
(dramatic music)

1003
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,309
- Well, goodbye.

1004
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,814
Thank you.

1005
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:55,550
(dramatic music)

1006
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:19,274
(door opening)

1007
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:35,924
What's this?

1008
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,928
- I thought I'd ask you that.

1009
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,564
- These are my letters.

1010
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,399
- Someone left them in the doorway.

1011
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,070
And whose money were you planning on using

1012
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,639
for some of them subscriptions?

1013
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:54,809
- I don't know.

1014
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,878
- And the other letters?

1015
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,814
When were you gonna tell me?

1016
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,919
(unsettling music)

1017
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,928
- All I wanted was a job.

1018
01:22:13,928 --> 01:22:16,431
Some place close, some place I could drive to.

1019
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,000
- And what were you planning on doing with Michael?

1020
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,604
Why don't you just admit it?

1021
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,106
That you want out of here.

1022
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:28,410
This is your life, our life, you belong here.

1023
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,711
- Nothing is right here and you know it.

1024
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:31,880
- This is your home.

1025
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,816
(unsettling music)

1026
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:48,496
Just because Michael's gone doesn't mean you can leave.

1027
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:49,698
- [Beth] Those are mine.

1028
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,370
- [Jacob] Beth, you are my wife.

1029
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,207
- Leave her alone.

1030
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,742
- Who the hell are you?

1031
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,210
- [Beth] Phillip get out of here.

1032
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,845
- Phillip?

1033
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,480
How do you know my wife?

1034
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,247
- [Beth] Jacob.

1035
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:07,649
- Huh? - Jacob.

1036
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,184
- How do you know my wife? - Leave him alone.

1037
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,452
- No.

1038
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,653
No, Beth. - How do you know her?

1039
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:12,887
- Wait.

1040
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,322
- Get the fuck off of my property.

1041
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,559
- Jacob stop. - How do you know my wife?

1042
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:18,426
- Beth. - Jacob.

1043
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,694
Jacob leave him alone.

1044
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:20,495
- [Phillip] You don't even know what I want.

1045
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:22,097
- Leave him alone.

1046
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,499
(thumping) - Oh no.

1047
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,769
(groaning) (thumping)

1048
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,804
- Jacob. - Come here.

1049
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:33,575
(unnerving music) (groaning)

1050
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:34,409
Huh, huh?

1051
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:38,146
- [Phillip] No.

1052
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,915
- What are you doing with my wife.

1053
01:23:40,915 --> 01:23:41,750
Huh?

1054
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:47,822
(mirror gouging) (groaning)

1055
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,571
(whimpering)

1056
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,177
(groaning)

1057
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,648
(coughing)

1058
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:20,021
(thunder booming)

1059
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,475
- Stay back. - It was an accident.

1060
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:43,878
- Just get out of here. - Are you alright?

1061
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,819
(crying) (roaring)

1062
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,287
- What was that?

1063
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:53,955
- Oh we gotta get inside.

1064
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:55,123
- [Beth] What?

1065
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,058
- Trust me.

1066
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,963
(unsettling music)

1067
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,549
What are you doing here?

1068
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:22,951
I'm here to help.

1069
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:26,888
Put the knife down.

1070
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,362
(breathing heavily)

1071
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,016
I know where your son is.

1072
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:56,918
- What?

1073
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,086
- You have to trust me.

1074
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,221
Put the knife down.

1075
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,189
- Do you have him? - No.

1076
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:04,659
I don't have him.

1077
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:09,964
Put down the knife and we'll talk.

1078
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:29,984
This may be hard to understand.

1079
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,655
I don't even understand it myself.

1080
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:37,559
It comes to me in flashes.

1081
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,700
I remember being taken.

1082
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,406
My parents were fighting downstairs and I

1083
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,813
just escaped, it took me away.

1084
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,551
That was a year ago.

1085
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,389
I was 13.

1086
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:14,896
I remember living my life, leaving here, everything.

1087
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,305
All those memories were just lies.

1088
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:33,481
It takes you to a place where you can't be seen.

1089
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,587
And it feeds off you.

1090
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:44,225
Whatever it is has your son.

1091
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:47,328
(crying)

1092
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:49,764
- How do you know this?

1093
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:53,801
- When I left I must've taken some of it with me.

1094
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:01,442
It's like it wants me to know.

1095
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:06,848
It'd take years off your life.

1096
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,353
When it's done it just spits you out.

1097
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:22,297
That's how it spreads.

1098
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,700
But now it's feeding faster.

1099
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,071
It's spreading from that dead acre.

1100
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,043
It's killing everything as it grows.

1101
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:42,650
When it takes you all you see is darkness,

1102
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:45,653
then the dreams begin.

1103
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:54,329
And after a while you start believing in it.

1104
01:28:56,964 --> 01:29:00,702
All the lies and everything it sort of feeds off of.

1105
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:09,210
Your son, how old is he?

1106
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,147
- He was six months.

1107
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:16,684
I heard his cries from the field

1108
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:19,220
but now they just sound different.

1109
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:22,523
- He's young.

1110
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:31,599
All he'll ever see is what it really is, it's nothing.

1111
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,638
The young ones last the longest.

1112
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:46,180
- Have you seen it?

1113
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:48,683
- No, it doesn't have a shape.

1114
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,321
I don't know why it came here.

1115
01:29:57,692 --> 01:30:02,597
But I know what it needs and I know when it's close.

1116
01:30:04,398 --> 01:30:06,601
It only feeds off me a little at a time.

1117
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,271
It's coming for you next.

1118
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:11,105
- What?

1119
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,644
- It's been watching you for a while now.

1120
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,548
I know everything it's thinking.

1121
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,620
And it knows everything you're thinking.

1122
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,657
All your thoughts.

1123
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:33,628
Your hopes and dreams.

1124
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,467
It's what it needs to survive.

1125
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:51,045
Oh god.

1126
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:53,948
Oh it's coming.

1127
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:58,853
It's coming.

1128
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,195
It's coming.

1129
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:10,131
(unsettling music)

1130
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,709
(phone ringing)

1131
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,669
- Beth?

1132
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:50,738
- [Beth] Yes.

1133
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:52,974
- Hey, how are you?

1134
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:55,810
I haven't seen you in a while.

1135
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:58,279
I've been worried about you.

1136
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:03,618
Where's Jacob?

1137
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:06,053
- [Beth] I thought he was still in town.

1138
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:08,155
- No, he left Carlson's the same time I did.

1139
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:11,058
Is everything alright?

1140
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:13,027
You sound kind of nervous.

1141
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,195
Do you want me to stop by?

1142
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:15,363
I could.

1143
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:16,397
- No really I'm fine. - I don't mind.

1144
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:22,470
Okay, well, I was just concerned.

1145
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:26,874
(knocking on door)

1146
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,944
(dial tone humming)

1147
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:32,780
(knocking on door)

1148
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,814
- [Jefferson] Beth, it's Jefferson.

1149
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:34,982
Come on, open the door.

1150
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:37,585
- [Beth] What's wrong?

1151
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,186
- [Jefferson] I gotta talk to you.

1152
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:41,689
- What? - It's okay Beth.

1153
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:42,890
Come on, open the door.

1154
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:47,428
(unsettling music)

1155
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,249
(phone ringing)

1156
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,717
I just got a couple of questions.

1157
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:10,651
Just a quick follow up and then I'm out of here.

1158
01:33:10,651 --> 01:33:11,886
- Hello?

1159
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,287
- [Jefferson] Beth it's Jefferson.

1160
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:15,156
- [Beth] Jefferson are you outside?

1161
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:17,224
- [Jefferson] No I'm on the road.

1162
01:33:17,224 --> 01:33:18,659
Are you alright Beth?

1163
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:24,966
Beth? (dial tone humming)

1164
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,368
(rattling)

1165
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:40,448
(unsettling music)

1166
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:57,331
- [Holly] Come on Beth open up.

1167
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,466
Beth it's fine. - Honey.

1168
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,867
- Jacob, what? - Beth.

1169
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:02,203
- Beth we're gonna help you. - It's okay sweetie.

1
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,932
To my parents,

2
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:13,065
who left everything.

3
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:37,499
Attachment

4
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:46,299
Chapter 1. Julia

5
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,099
Mom, now that Dad sgoing to be here all day,

6
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:10,799
have you thought about doing something

7
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,099
Your Dad, here all day!

8
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,799
It could be fun.

9
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,099
You ve been wanting to remodel the back,

10
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,499
and Dad likes working with wood.

11
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:25,199
It could be a nice project.

12
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,366
Hurry up, honey.

13
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,733
Mom, we re talking here!

14
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,099
Whisky!

15
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,733
That one was good.

16
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,366
Let me see how it came out.

17
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:47,132
Let s take a look, wehave to approve first.

18
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,432
If I look bad I say no.

19
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,333
Allow me, boss.

20
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:52,666
Here it is.

21
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:53,833
See guys!

22
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,165
Excellent!

23
00:02:58,632 --> 00:02:59,666
Pretty!

24
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:03,666
We can send it to the relatives in Chile.

25
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,866
Who is that?

26
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,432
I don t know.

27
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:09,033
Look closely,

28
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,266
your grandpa!

29
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,099
When he was younger.

30
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,866
He was doing a military training in Cuba.

31
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,866
So he was a soldier?

32
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,766
Something like that.

33
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,532
And were you a solider too?

34
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,199
No!

35
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:31,732
No, honey, I hate war,because the only thing it does

36
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,132
is separate families.

37
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,966
Could you help me write a letter?

38
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:39,899
Yes.

39
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,933
To who?

40
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,933
To my dad.

41
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,966
Bye!

42
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,833
You re gonna get it now!

43
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,133
The underwear is crazy!

44
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,966
Kids, we re leaving.

45
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:57,632
No!

46
00:03:57,732 --> 00:03:59,632
What are you doing?

47
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,432
Nothing.

48
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:02,265
What a mess!

49
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,299
None.

50
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,399
Get going, they re waiting for you.

51
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,265
No, mom!

52
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Get going.

53
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,299
They re waiting for you.

54
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,099
Don t run, help Cami please.

55
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:56,432
Claudia has me worried.

56
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,299
She seems really sad.

57
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:09,965
I m talking to you.

58
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:11,132
Yes, yes.

59
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,132
Hello?

60
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,332
Good morning, honey, how are you?

61
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:56,866
Your daughter openeda Facebook page for me

62
00:07:56,866 --> 00:08:00,466
and I don t know what to do with it.

63
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:05,733
Well you re supposed to post pictures,

64
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:09,233
write something for people to read.

65
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,232
What for?

66
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:15,032
What people? There s no one here.

67
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:17,932
This is too darn complicated.

68
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:21,666
If you don t like itclose it and that s that.

69
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,266
How nice of you!

70
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:27,432
Is it that hard for youto help me understand it?

71
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,532
Go to the search bar.

72
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,865
What search bar?

73
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:35,199
The little magnifying glass at the top.

74
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,065
At the top of the page

75
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,566
Ok, got it, the little one.

76
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:39,132
Yes.

77
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,999
OK

78
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,199
You write the name of the personyou want to look for there,

79
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,099
press enter, and it shows up.

80
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,165
I m going to put yours.

81
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:51,465
No, Mom, not mine. Why?

82
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,499
We see each other every day, youre going to spy on me there too?

83
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:58,866
I don t know why I wastemy time with you Ana,

84
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,866
now I understand your husband.

85
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,833
Mom, hey!

86
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:04,099
Mom!

87
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:42,065
Hello?

88
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:46,432
OK, I m coming.

89
00:09:56,632 --> 00:10:01,632
We ve just been hired todevelop a beach hotel in Mexico

90
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,532
in Los Cabos.

91
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:08,565
So you and Fernández, are eachgoing to present a project

92
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:12,499
and the one the client likes best goes.

93
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:16,199
This is a big deal that can helpus on an international level.

94
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,199
Of course.

95
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,299
I m counting on you and Iwant something extraordinary.

96
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,599
Nothing less,

97
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:22,966
OK

98
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,066
Understood?

99
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,165
High five!

100
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:38,132
Where should we send the plane?

101
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:39,032
Let s see

102
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,299
Oh God, that can t be.

103
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,999
Why do I look so old?

104
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:52,165
Why so close up!

105
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,766
How awful!

106
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:59,065
Let s try it without glasses,maybe it will come out better.

107
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:01,232
Don t be so cruel, find a good angle.

108
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:03,732
I took it with affection!

109
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,032
How about a smile?

110
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:16,199
Look at my cheeks, I look like Kiko.

111
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,099
This one is pretty.

112
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,999
Let me see... I like it

113
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:24,866
Yes, I like it! It s not that bad.

114
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,065
It s pretty!

115
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:26,965
This one?

116
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:27,866
Are you going to put it up now?

117
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:28,532
Yes.

118
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,833
Does it take a long time?

119
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:38,333
No, it s really fast,even Claudia can do it.

120
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,632
She showed me, she made the page.

121
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
She s so smart.

122
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:47,265
Kids these days, it s incredible.

123
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,565
They learn really fast.

124
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:52,832
Speaking of,

125
00:11:52,832 --> 00:11:56,099
have you noticed that Claudia s been sad?

126
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:56,999
Sad, why?

127
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,399
I don t know.

128
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,432
She seems sad lately.

129
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:04,733
I think she should see her father more.

130
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,233
Enough already.

131
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,232
Your daughters need tobe with their dad more.

132
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,832
They need a dad.

133
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,966
What s the password?

134
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:12,000
What password?

135
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,300
For Facebook.

136
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,699
Concepción 68.

137
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,632
Ana, I m being serious,

138
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:23,765
they need a father figure.

139
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:26,833
Aren t you going to say anything?

140
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,633
No, Mom.

141
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:34,965
Only one!

142
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:42,332
Simon says throw Camila in the fountain.

143
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,265
Let s go!

144
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,599
To the fountain!

145
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:57,232
I found a bunch of childhood friends.

146
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:01,699
I ve been chatting with an oldcollege friend all week, Ernesto.

147
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,999
What does he do?

148
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,165
Pass me the bread.

149
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,232
He owns hotels in La Serena.

150
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:07,332
In La Serena? Hotels?

151
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,199
He must be one of your snobfriends, probably pro-Pinochet.

152
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:18,566
Adri and me want to go toChile, we want to take the kids.

153
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,933
Yes. Yesterday we were watchinga report about Torres del Paine

154
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,032
You know what the problem isthings aren t like they used to be,

155
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:30,932
Chile is full of snobsnow, living the high life.

156
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,399
All that sacrifice for nothing.

157
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:38,566
Right, all that sacrifice for nothing.

158
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:40,366
What do you mean for nothing?

159
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,566
What s wrong with living well.

160
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,866
There s nothing wrong with living well.

161
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,532
What s wrong is living well atthe expense of everyone else.

162
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,165
All your friends got rich atthe expense of everyone else.

163
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,332
And in those cases, youbring the housekeeper

164
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,699
to live here and pay her better.

165
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,766
So how is your friend?

166
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,866
Ernesto is very well.

167
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,299
He invited me to go there for a few days.

168
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:08,132
That s a good idea, we were talking about

169
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,566
going together, all of us.

170
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:13,299
We can take our vacation days,

171
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,165
take the kids and all go together.

172
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,265
Claudia is dying to go.

173
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,733
Fabio has never been on aplane, it would be so nice.

174
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,232
I m going alone

175
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:24,332
The Atacama Desert is the best.

176
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,665
I m going alone!

177
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,399
I m going alone!

178
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,632
What do you mean, alone?

179
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,933
You ve always said you dont like to travel alone.

180
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:37,833
Now I do.

181
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:42,366
Isn t it a little weird to go alone

182
00:14:42,366 --> 00:14:44,366
to see a guy you don t even know?

183
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,966
The Opus Dei has spoken.

184
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,232
What s that supposed to mean?

185
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:48,899
She wants to go alone.

186
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,532
But we re family, we canmake the decision together.

187
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:53,632
It s not our decision, it s hers.

188
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,899
I think it s somethingthat affects us all.

189
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,099
We have to make a plan together.

190
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:59,933
This one looks great on you.

191
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,133
You like it?

192
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,666
It s not too wide?

193
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,166
It looks great.

194
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,265
It doesn t make my hips look big?

195
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,799
Look at your face, youlook fresh, younger.

196
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,933
That s so sweet, honey.

197
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,933
I m going to get it.

198
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,232
Yes, get it.

199
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:23,466
So, they offered to send me toMexico to develop a project.

200
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:28,632
It s a competition, it s not for sure yet.

201
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,666
Are you listening to me?

202
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,332
Yes.

203
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:36,732
And what would you do with the girls?

204
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,766
You re going to take themaway from their family,

205
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,399
take them out of schoolin the middle of the year,

206
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,966
with all of the support they have?

207
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,466
I don t know, mom.

208
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:49,766
I haven t thought about that yet.

209
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,132
I gave up everything foryou guys and your father.

210
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:53,232
Everything.

211
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,032
You came here because you wanted to,

212
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:58,132
nobody forced you to.

213
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:02,332
Is that really what you think?

214
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,799
That I wanted to leave my country,

215
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,999
my family, my friends,

216
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:09,799
my job,

217
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,766
my life?

218
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:18,632
Is that really what you think, Ana?

219
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:21,566
I brought you some more in your size.

220
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,265
Thank you.

221
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:23,765
You re welcome.

222
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,899
I ll take them to the dressing room.

223
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,800
What this shows is knowledge,a way of doing things,

224
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,966
the skills of our trade.

225
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:11,599
I understand, César.

226
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,532
I understand your proposal completely.

227
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,499
What I m worried about isthe economic side of it,

228
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:19,065
because our image is at stake

229
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,565
Dad: Your mom has a lover

230
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:25,666
and I don t want it toend up being too simple.

231
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,266
Ana, are you OK?

232
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:31,099
Well that won t be the case, less is more.

233
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:36,099
And your investment is going tobe reflected in these decisions.

234
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,266
Dad, are you crazy?

235
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,166
That s impossible.

236
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,866
We ll talk later, I m inthe middle of a meeting.

237
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:35,799
OK.

238
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,132
OK.

239
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,466
Bye.

240
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,366
In this previous project,

241
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:55,699
with the same base of these littleislands, autonomous elements,

242
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:02,932
we re going to create a seriesof communications that are

243
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:08,632
more fluid for the user andthat gives us the framework

244
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:11,433
for this current project.

245
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,099
César, I m clear on theidea, but we re going to

246
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:21,832
need a more down-to-earth advance.

247
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Of course.

248
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,699
My two collaborators havebeen working out ideas

249
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:35,466
and they will share thosepreliminary results with us.

250
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:40,165
Ana?

251
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,632
Yes, one second,

252
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:47,832
I just have to find the document.

253
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,199
While Ana is getting ready

254
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:55,432
I wanted to tell you about my proposal

255
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:59,265
which is based on the rawmaterials we re going to use,

256
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,565
which are of the highest quality.

257
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:15,432
It is cold. But just thinkingabout you I get warm.

258
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:18,332
When I have your sweet penis

259
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,066
Are you OK?

260
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,599
No, I don t feel so well.

261
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,999
You look pale.

262
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:38,132
Very pale

263
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,065
My blood pressure is just low.

264
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,565
Want something?

265
00:21:41,565 --> 00:21:42,866
No, don t worry.

266
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,065
It ll pass soon.

267
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:45,365
Are you sure?

268
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:48,933
Don t worry, it happens sometimes.

269
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,933
One, two, three, four, and five.

270
00:21:55,233 --> 00:22:00,233
Very good, we re going toopen our legs, flex that knee,

271
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,499
not forcing it.

272
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,165
And back.

273
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,566
Now the other one.

274
00:22:09,966 --> 00:22:10,699
Auch!!!

275
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,165
Alicia help her please, slowly.

276
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:19,966
Come here!

277
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:22,699
Be careful

278
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,566
it s just a cramp.

279
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,866
He s not that ugly.

280
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:06,966
He s awful!

281
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:10,432
He has the face of a pervert,

282
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:12,699
but these things happen,it s not his fault.

283
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:13,332
Gross!

284
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,700
It s not that bad

285
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,799
Besides, it s not exactlylike you ve dated models.

286
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,699
No, he looks awful.

287
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:24,332
This seriously doesn t bother you?

288
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,799
This is the guy Mom isgoing to go away with.

289
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,599
That s one thing, but Dad hasnt exactly been the best guy,

290
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:36,165
it s not like we can hold it against Mom.

291
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:37,866
What s wrong is...

292
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:40,466
Why would Dad send me this?

293
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,132
He s not going to send it to me,

294
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,733
I don t want to see that picture.

295
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,432
He can barely remember my birthday.

296
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:51,432
Poor thing, no one remembers thebaby of the family s birthday.

297
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:02,065
Have you ever thoughtwhat it would be like

298
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:05,199
if we d been born there, in Chile?

299
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,733
Our grandparents...

300
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:12,465
a mom... I don t know...

301
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:16,532
We d be the same, butit would have been nice

302
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:20,432
to have more family, it s just us here.

303
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:25,799
Have cousins, not only us.

304
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:31,366
Mom would be less hysterical.

305
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:35,366
Mom isn t hysterical, she s complicated.

306
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:44,799
Chapter 2. Ana.

307
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:45,399
Hi

308
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,399
I m close by and I thought wecould get some coffee or something.

309
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:56,866
I can t, I m still at the office.

310
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:57,999
Can I call you in a bit?

311
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,699
I m in a meeting.

312
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:29,532
Hi, honey.

313
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,999
- How are you? - Good.

314
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,099
Mommy, look, we have a dog.

315
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,632
His name is Chocolito.

316
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:38,032
Chocolito!

317
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,833
He wants to go in the bedroom.

318
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,233
Are you crazy?

319
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:42,632
You bought them a dog?

320
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:43,632
Hi, Anita.

321
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:48,499
That dog is going to stay here?

322
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,599
We talked about this last year.

323
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,733
Last year, not now.

324
00:27:55,366 --> 00:28:00,366
We agreed that the girls needto learn about responsibility.

325
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:06,366
Besides, when was the lasttime you saw them this happy?

326
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,532
Does he have his vaccines?

327
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:15,666
Yeah, he has one left butI can take him next week.

328
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,966
And the food?

329
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:19,632
Cami has a little food in her backpack,

330
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:21,265
and I can help you out with some more,

331
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,365
it s cheap.

332
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,799
He s really cute.

333
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,232
You should have told me.

334
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:33,399
I m sorry.

335
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:38,499
I need you to pay the girls tuition,

336
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,265
they ve been calling me all the time.

337
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:42,965
For two weeks straight now.

338
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:46,632
I can deposit some moneyin your account tomorrow,

339
00:28:46,632 --> 00:28:49,366
the rest I ll have to pay you back causeI don t get paid until the other week.

340
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,065
That s not an option,

341
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,432
they ve been expecting thepayment for too long now.

342
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,132
Call the school yourself,explain your situation

343
00:28:56,132 --> 00:28:58,032
and that way they don t thinkthat I don t want to pay.

344
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,165
Call who?

345
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:04,132
I don t know, the principal, thebilling department, call, ask.

346
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:04,499
OK.

347
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,666
Girls, I m leaving.

348
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:07,666
Bye, Daddy.

349
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,766
I love you.

350
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:10,132
Bye cutie!

351
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,099
Bye, Chocolito.

352
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:17,999
Bye, Anita.

353
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:18,832
Thanks!

354
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:21,099
Anita!

355
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:21,799
What?

356
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,199
Do you remember the deal with the firm?

357
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,833
The meeting is Saturday.

358
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,199
No, no way!

359
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,165
This is too much!

360
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:39,265
We talked about me havingSaturday for forever.

361
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:40,765
I need to work.

362
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,733
It s a one-time thing.

363
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:46,299
I just need to trade you for Wednesday,

364
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:47,899
I ll take the girls Wednesday and Thursday

365
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:49,666
and you take them Saturday.

366
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,733
I can t! I have too much work that day.

367
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:53,233
I can t say no.

368
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:55,532
I can t say no.

369
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:59,199
So you ll take them on Wednesday.

370
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,699
Until Thursday.

371
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:01,833
Ok, fine, get out of here.

372
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:02,833
Thank you.

373
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:03,599
Bye.

374
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:16,866
That looks fun, honey.Where did you get those?

375
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:18,132
Aunt Nicole gave them to me

376
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:18,799
Who?

377
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:23,199
Aunt Nicole, Daddy s girlfriend.

378
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,599
That s pretty for playing dress up, right?

379
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,933
But not for wearing in real life.

380
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:35,333
I m going to be a model.

381
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,065
You could also be an artist,

382
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:43,733
a singer,

383
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:46,765
an astronaut...

384
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:53,399
I m going to be theprettiest model in the world.

385
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,533
One, two, three!

386
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:02,132
Hi!

387
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,299
Hi Mom!

388
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,132
How are you, doña Ana?

389
00:31:05,132 --> 00:31:05,766
Fine.

390
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:12,466
I m so sorry, I m soembarrassed, traffic was awful.

391
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,866
Don t worry.

392
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:16,265
I wanted to talk to you about something.

393
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,432
Do you have a few minutes?

394
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:18,099
Yes.

395
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:21,733
Girls stay here a minute,we ll be right back,

396
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:22,833
don t move.

397
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,733
Let s seat there.

398
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,866
Is something wrong?

399
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,266
Nothing serious, really.

400
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,399
This morning Claudia bit a classmate,

401
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:35,966
that s never happened before

402
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,065
and I ve noticed she sbeen really rebellious,

403
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,232
she s been different lately.

404
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,832
She is changing.

405
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:45,666
Claudia s dad and I separated recently.

406
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:51,632
And it s been hard to schedule the visits

407
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,499
and Claudia is really close with him.

408
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,099
It could be that it s affecting her.

409
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:02,532
Maybe without realizingit you re transmitting

410
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:05,632
a little bit of anxiety to her.

411
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,299
Maybe, I hadn t thought of it that way.

412
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,699
Just saying...

413
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:14,899
In any case, don t worry,here at school we have

414
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,799
a really good psychologist.

415
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,766
If you want I can scheduleher an appointment.

416
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:24,399
What s going to happen tothese little guys today?

417
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,933
I want you to read us Sleeping Beauty.

418
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:28,966
No, that s so boring.

419
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:31,666
No. The story of Chocolito.

420
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:33,899
OK. Once upon a time

421
00:32:35,032 --> 00:32:38,132
there was a dog named Chocolito

422
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:42,099
and he liked to go to the park.

423
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,365
I wanna go to the park!

424
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:53,366
And then Chocolito realizedthat they closed the park.

425
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:59,065
But Chocolito wasn t alone...

426
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:34,132
Hello?

427
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:38,765
Daniel!

428
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:43,765
But you promised, you re kidding me.

429
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,132
Claudia is going to a psychologist

430
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:51,932
and you think that s normal.

431
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,132
Moron.

432
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,032
What s wrong Mom?

433
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,066
Nothing, honey.

434
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,199
I have to take you to Grandma s,

435
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,999
do you want to go?

436
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:06,633
Let s go.

437
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,799
Ducks in the water!

438
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:11,132
Mommy,

439
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:11,566
Yes?

440
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,999
Why hasn t Dad come to see us?

441
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,399
Why doesn t Dad love us?

442
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:23,733
Of course he loves you, hes just been really busy,

443
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,632
so he hasn t had timeto come see you guys,

444
00:34:25,632 --> 00:34:27,332
but he will soon,

445
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,532
you can go out and do something.

446
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:34,432
It s your fault because youre always bothering him.

447
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,966
It s not my fault, I don t bother him.

448
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:38,866
The only thing I ask of himis that he does the things

449
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,632
that he s supposed to.

450
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:42,366
It s very convenient that I m the only one

451
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:44,299
who worries about you guys.

452
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,332
He worries about us, he gave us Chocolito,

453
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:50,065
and you re always asking for more money

454
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:52,165
and a lot more money.

455
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:54,432
Claudia, you re dad doesn t have the money

456
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:58,332
because he spends it on his girlfriend.

457
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:12,065
Hello!

458
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:21,699
Hi honey!

459
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:23,232
Hi.

460
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,233
What happened?

461
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:30,599
Why do you have that look on your face?

462
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,766
Girls, please, unbuckle your seatbelts.

463
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:36,065
I don t know why you insiston working at a company

464
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,532
that doesn t appreciate you.

465
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,599
It s not that they don tvalue me, that s how it is,

466
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,000
you have to go to work sothat they pay you more.

467
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,399
Why don t you change jobs?

468
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:47,299
Your brother can get you one.

469
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:52,365
Have you thought about gettingback together with Daniel,

470
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,499
he s such an honorable guy, so loving.

471
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:59,432
Mom, enough, I don t havetime for this right now.

472
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:02,766
Where are my beautiful girls?

473
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:06,099
Give your grandma a hug.

474
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,432
Where s my baby?

475
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,499
Come here baby,

476
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:14,832
come to grandma.

477
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:22,766
Go on in, I want to talk to your mother.

478
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:27,232
You re okay with it because I m the one

479
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,299
who takes care of the girls,

480
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,432
but I m not trying to rub it in your face,

481
00:36:32,432 --> 00:36:34,199
it just worries me thatyou re at a job where

482
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,299
you can t even pay for a nanny.

483
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:39,199
It s not that I don t makeenough, it s that Daniel

484
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,799
doesn t help me at all.

485
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,599
I had to pay two monthsof the girls school,

486
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,733
he doesn t give memoney, it s not my fault.

487
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,699
Chocolito!

488
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,332
Who s Chocolito?

489
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,432
You mean you re goingto leave that dog here?

490
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:53,232
Mom, I can t take him to work.

491
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:56,099
And your dad s allergies?No, absolutely not.

492
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,065
Chocolito, come here!

493
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,299
Go get him.

494
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:06,432
So, who wants dessert, wehave pancakes with honey,

495
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:11,532
pancakes with dulce de leche,we can make a cheese tart,

496
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:16,132
the one I made last time.Or... what do you want?

497
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:18,265
Come say hi to your grandpa princesses

498
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:19,365

Here s a little present foryou, and for you, and this one

500
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:29,833

501
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,366
Thank you!

502
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:34,000
I m gonna get you! Here I come!

503
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,366
Hi!

504
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:35,533
Hi Dad.

505
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:41,432
Aren t you going to do something?

506
00:37:41,432 --> 00:37:43,733
You re just going to letMom go away with a stranger?

507
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:47,199
He s not a stranger to your mother.

508
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,299
Look, at this stage in the game

509
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:54,032
it s very hard to fall in love again,

510
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:56,832
even for you, it s not easy.

511
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I can t take the dog to themeeting, absolutely not.

512
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,366
Me neither, they won t let metake the dog to my work either.

513
00:38:16,366 --> 00:38:17,666
My job is important too.

514
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,299
This is an office.

515
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:21,099
And you know what else,you bought that dog,

516
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,599
it should be your responsibility.

517
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,199
Just like going to see thegirls every once in a while.

518
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,799
I m dying to spend moretime with my girls,

519
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:30,165
but as long as this deallasts, I have less time

520
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:31,665
they know that.

521
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:34,599
I could care less, becausewhen you are with them

522
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:37,666
it s a problem too, you letthem do whatever they want

523
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,566
and then when I set anyrules they think I m crazy.

524
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:41,000
That s not true.

525
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,733
Give this back to your girlfriend

526
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:43,933
What s this?

527
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:47,999
And I don t want her buying anymore sexist toys for Claudia.

528
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,933
Claudia asked for that.

529
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:51,899
It doesn t matter, doesn tyour girlfriend have a brain

530
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:52,899
to say no?

531
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:56,833
She should, she s a political scientist

532
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,833
I m sorry.

533
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:00,865
You re an idiot,

534
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,399
I m nervous!

535
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,899
You don t even deserve Chocolito.

536
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:06,599
Anita, I m sorry.

537
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:35,132
You have a lot of talent,

538
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,232
I was sure that you were goingto really dive into this,

539
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:41,399
that you were going to make it your own,

540
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:43,599
and I don t see a lot.

541
00:40:44,432 --> 00:40:49,332
I ve just been really busyand I m a little stuck

542
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:52,399
on the whole parking lot thing.

543
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:56,532
I promise that next week I mgoing to show you something

544
00:40:56,532 --> 00:41:00,632
that you ll like a lot, Ijust need a little more time.

545
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:04,699
OK, but there isn t a lot oftime and I m counting on you.

546
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,199
Yes, thank you.

547
00:41:56,999 --> 00:41:59,699
It s really dangerous, Mom.

548
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:02,399
I m really worried, you havent seen this guy in forever,

549
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:04,766
he could be a psychopath or something.

550
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:07,866
Honey, why don t you get offthat little high horse of yours?

551
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:09,899
What did we come here for?

552
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:12,666
To celebrate! So, glasses up!

553
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:13,799
Let s wait for Dad.

554
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:14,566
Cheers!

555
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,366
Oh, my love!

556
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:18,965
Gorgeous.

557
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:23,732
Oh, my love.

558
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:29,832
What s wrong with this guy?

559
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:30,799
Sir?

560
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:32,466
Sir! No!

561
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:57,766
Oh, no, what are you doing?

562
00:42:57,766 --> 00:42:59,466
What s happening?

563
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,065
Clau

564
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:32,566
What s up, you can t sleep?

565
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:33,232
No.

566
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:50,932
Do you miss Daddy?

567
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:57,132
Sometimes.

568
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:00,332
I always do.

569
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:08,299
Is that why you bit your classmate?

570
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:10,699
No. He was bothering me.

571
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:19,933
Honey, sometimes people dothings that you don t understand,

572
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:25,333
but that doesn t meanyou have to hurt them.

573
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:38,933
Give me that, let me help you.

574
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:39,933
Thank you.

575
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:43,233
Hi, honey, how are you?

576
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:45,799
Let s play by the tree, come on.

577
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:47,065
How are you, Anita?

578
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:48,065
Good, Rita, and you?

579
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:49,499
Good. Thanks, honey.

580
00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:51,499
Rita, can you watch Chocolito, please?

581
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,666
They re going to fire me ifI take him to work again.

582
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,366
Don t worry, I ll see what I can do.

583
00:44:55,366 --> 00:44:57,799
Your dad is in bed sohe won t even notice.

584
00:44:57,799 --> 00:44:58,699
Is he OK?

585
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,899
I don t know, he doesn t feel well,

586
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:02,933
he s been locked up inhis room since yesterday

587
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:03,799
And Mom?

588
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:05,199
In the garden.

589
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:09,632
Watch my car for a sec,I m going to say hi.

590
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:11,032
Yes, go ahead.

591
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:11,733
Girls!

592
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:53,966
Hi, honey.

593
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:55,132
Hi,

594
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:57,332
is Dad sick?

595
00:45:58,599 --> 00:45:59,899
He has a UTI.

596
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:04,599
But you know how he is, he exaggerates.

597
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:07,866
Don t you think maybeyou can delay your trip?

598
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:10,366
Why would I do that? My God!

599
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:13,466
Your father is a hypochondriac.

600
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:18,566
If you re so worried takecare of him yourself.

601
00:46:18,566 --> 00:46:19,666
Hi, Grammy.

602
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:22,299
Hello, my granddaughters,

603
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:23,999
let s do Tai Chi,

604
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:27,199
feet together,

605
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,666
one leg here,

606
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:36,799
lower and raise the energy,

607
00:46:38,032 --> 00:46:40,065
lower the energy,

608
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,399
put your foot there,

609
00:46:44,966 --> 00:46:46,199
do the urn,

610
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,299
comb the hair.

611
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:19,399
I remember when we werepacking to come here.

612
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:20,566
Me too.

613
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,999
I ve never been more scared in my life.

614
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:29,666
I thought they were goingto detain us in the airport,

615
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:34,266
that Marito was goingto be born on the plane.

616
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:37,499
I would have liked

617
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:41,832
for things to have been different.

618
00:48:35,766 --> 00:48:40,066
Isn t a lot of stufffor such a short trip?

619
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,833
OK, alright already.

620
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,265
Write me when you got there.

621
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:58,132
Yes, honey, I ll write you, don t worry.

622
00:48:58,132 --> 00:49:00,399
Let me know when you re comingback and I ll pick you up.

623
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:02,165
Well, I don t know yet.

624
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:03,865
What do you mean?

625
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:05,733
I ll let you know.

626
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:08,366
I don t want to miss myflight. Kisses to the kids,

627
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:10,265
I love you a lot, I love you.

628
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:13,465
When did you buy the ticket for?

629
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:39,566
Where is Grandma, whyhaven t we gone to see her?

630
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:42,966
She s in another countryseeing her boyfriend.

631
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:45,466
Isn t Grandpa her boyfriend?

632
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:48,266
No, silly, he s her husband.

633
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:54,765
Mommy it itches!

634
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:56,366
What s going on?

635
00:49:56,366 --> 00:49:58,666
Mommy, come, it itches.

636
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:04,499
Claudia!

637
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:07,499
Why would you do that to your sister?

638
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:09,899
Can t you see she s sick?

639
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:11,933
But she looks like a Pegasus.

640
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:14,233
A mess is what this is.

641
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:18,232
Go get a bowl to clean this up.

642
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:20,699
But Mommy she looks pretty.

643
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,799
Claudia go! I m not messing around.

644
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:23,432
Hurry.

645
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:27,366
Honey,

646
00:50:29,399 --> 00:50:31,699
What did you sister do!

647
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,099
Clau, open the door.

648
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:44,866
I m going.

649
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:54,665
- Hi - Hi, Clau.

650
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:57,165
What happened?

651
00:50:57,165 --> 00:50:58,466
I m in trouble with my mom.

652
00:50:58,466 --> 00:50:59,899
Why?

653
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:02,699
Because I made Cami a costume.

654
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,000
What do you mean?

655
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,800
A Pegasus costume.

656
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,065
Where is your mom?

657
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,665
In the bathroom.

658
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:11,733
Let s go.

659
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:23,699
I don t understand it, but I like it.

660
00:51:23,699 --> 00:51:24,699
Thank you.

661
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:30,633
Don t encourage her, sheshouldn t have done it.

662
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:39,666
I think I should just stayhome, this is a disaster.

663
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:43,965
I ll stay with the girls, I ll fix it.

664
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:47,599
I don t feel I even want to go.

665
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:52,766
Go for a little bit, ifyou don t like it come back

666
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:54,466
and I have wine.

667
00:51:55,065 --> 00:51:56,465
And that s it.

668
00:51:56,465 --> 00:52:01,465
He probably got married anddoesn t feel like coming.

669
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:02,799
Hi.

670
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:04,032
Ay, how are you?

671
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:05,032

It s been forever! I m so glad you came.

674
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:11,332
It s so great to see you guys!

675
00:52:11,332 --> 00:52:12,165
How have you been?

676
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:13,432
Great.

677
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:15,065
Super.

678
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,532
That s great, I m happy to hear that.

679
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,899
You didn t bring thatgood-looking husband of yours?

680
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:21,532
He s not my husband anymore.

681
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:23,032
Aw, I thought so, theother day I saw him...

682
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:23,666
Hello.

683
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:26,799
Hello.

684
00:52:27,733 --> 00:52:28,833
Ana, right?

685
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:30,065
Yes.

686
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,866
And you re...

687
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:36,599
Federico.

688
00:52:36,932 --> 00:52:41,932
I m sorry, I m the worst,I have a super bad memory.

689
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:43,132
It s fine.

690
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:48,632
Bored?

691
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,466
Well, yes, actually, I am.

692
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:55,366
I don t know why I even came.

693
00:52:55,366 --> 00:52:57,532
Morbid curiosity, same as me.

694
00:52:57,532 --> 00:52:58,432
Probably.

695
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:08,265
That chick back there, you know?

696
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:09,765
Yeah, you know.

697
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:11,999
You re awful!

698
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:17,766
And I m not totally sure,

699
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:22,032
but I think maybe her over there,

700
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,132
although they look pretty natural.

701
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:27,132
But with that dress...

702
00:53:27,132 --> 00:53:28,932
It s hard to tell.

703
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:36,899
How many have had a gastric bypass?

704
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:38,165
Me.

705
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:41,833
No, I m serious.

706
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,065
I m serious too.

707
00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:44,699
No.

708
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,899
Because of my thyroid.

709
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,665
I m sorry, I m the worst.

710
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:52,733
I m sorry.

711
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:54,365
Don t worry.

712
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,366
It wasn t my intention, really.

713
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,066
Relax, it s fine.

714
00:53:58,066 --> 00:53:59,933
But there s nothing wrongwith getting a gastric bypass.

715
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:01,333
Of course not.

716
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:07,632
You know you re the lastperson I d have imagined here.

717
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:08,799
Why?

718
00:54:10,232 --> 00:54:13,632
You were one of the popular girls.

719
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:17,032
I was not popular, not even close.

720
00:54:17,032 --> 00:54:19,632
At least one of the pretty ones.

721
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:20,932
What a clown!

722
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:23,866
I m serious.

723
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:30,333
I was crazy over you in high school.

724
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,333
I really liked you a lot.

725
00:54:36,165 --> 00:54:36,799
A lot.

726
00:56:02,366 --> 00:56:05,566
Chapter 3. Andrés.

727
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:58,099
Today we re going to talk abouta series of political movements,

728
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:04,299
from the wars of independenceup to the present,

729
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,799
that have influenced the realityof Latin America in some way.

730
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:46,632
Hello?

731
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:52,132
Yes, I have it turned off.

732
00:57:52,132 --> 00:57:53,532
What happened?

733
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:57,399
What?!

734
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:02,532
No. I m coming.

735
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:05,599
Yes, I ll be there in 20 minutes.

736
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,432
OK. Bye.

737
00:58:16,499 --> 00:58:17,499
Thank you.

738
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:21,432
I talked to the doctors.

739
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:24,532
He s fine, he has an infection,

740
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:27,499
he didn t take care of itproperly, it caused complications.

741
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:30,799
They still have to do some exams.

742
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,866
They re recommending he doesn t stay alone

743
00:58:33,866 --> 00:58:36,166
because he s depressed,

744
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:41,366
we have to figure outwhat we re going to do.

745
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:45,232
And with Mom on vacation.

746
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:47,632
What are we going to do?

747
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:53,566
We were thinking and maybewe could pay someone.

748
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:57,933
Like split the cost of a carer.

749
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:04,799
Well, we could pay for her, andhe could stay at your house.

750
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:09,232
But my house is so smalland now I have a dog, too,

751
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:11,032
how would I do it?

752
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,133
No, I can t.

753
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:16,733
In Diego s apartment it s impossible

754
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:20,333
and in my house he won t be happy...

755
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:25,666
There s a spare room inyour house, it s bigger.

756
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:28,866
We were thinking aboutthe emotional aspects,

757
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,266
that he feel encouraged.

758
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:34,232
He s not going to feelbetter in a tiny little room

759
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:36,332
than in your house in a bigger room.

760
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:38,833
You re his favorite,he s always said that.

761
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:39,733
He can t stay at my house.

762
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:40,733
Excuse me.

763
00:59:40,866 --> 00:59:41,966
Hello, yes?

764
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,432
Doña Ana, I m sorry,

765
01:00:04,432 --> 01:00:06,232
can I speak with you?

766
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:07,232
Of course,

767
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:11,766
what s up?

768
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,999
It s about your Dad.

769
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:20,566
Did he say something to you?

770
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,166
Treat you badly?

771
01:00:22,366 --> 01:00:24,166
No, that s not it.

772
01:00:26,032 --> 01:00:28,332
But he does bad things.

773
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:31,232
Like what?

774
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,733
It doesn t matter.

775
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:42,766
But I think I can t work here anymore.

776
01:00:42,766 --> 01:00:44,266
Esmeralda, why?

777
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:49,499
Anita, my tea!

778
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:52,132
Ay, Dad, I m coming!

779
01:00:56,466 --> 01:00:59,166
Look, let s talk later, OK?

780
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:00,899
Yes, OK.

781
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:09,933
He was already annoying, and now this.

782
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,432
Yeah and now that Momabandoned him, worse.

783
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:15,032
Mom didn t abandon him,Mom went on vacation.

784
01:01:15,032 --> 01:01:19,999
But since he s used to everyonedoing everything for him.

785
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:24,999
Well I m sick of that, tiredof wondering what s wrong,

786
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:29,566
or if he s OK. I shouldn t care anymore.

787
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:36,132
If he s already being such apain it s because he s better.

788
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:51,666
Dad!

789
01:01:53,866 --> 01:01:55,566
What s up, honey?

790
01:01:55,566 --> 01:01:57,199
Why are you walking around like that?

791
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:58,899
I feel more comfortable.

792
01:01:58,899 --> 01:02:00,899
Yes, Dad, but not here.

793
01:02:00,899 --> 01:02:02,799
Now I understand poor Esmeralda.

794
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,099
I thought she had left.

795
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:16,466
That s why there are gardensfor the kids to play in.

796
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:20,866
They can play tennis, goswimming, go riding, and they can

797
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,399
even go to the stadium.

798
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:24,132
And I can go there?

799
01:02:24,132 --> 01:02:26,799
Of course you can go.

800
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:29,366
Now it s time...

801
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:33,265
What are you doing here? Whydidn t you get on the school bus?

802
01:02:33,265 --> 01:02:34,865
Grandpa said so.

803
01:02:35,499 --> 01:02:39,899
It s just kindergarten,it s not a big deal.

804
01:02:39,899 --> 01:02:43,199
No, Dad. Now I have to take her to school.

805
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,232
And I m late. Come on Cami, get out here,

806
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:48,132
go find your shoes.

807
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,200
We ll finish it later.

808
01:02:51,699 --> 01:02:53,699
It was too much Dad.

809
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:02,766
Hi, Mom, since you leftDad is doing poorly

810
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:05,166
and everything is chaos.

811
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,399
Hi, Mom, I m happy you re having fun

812
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:21,499
but Dad isn t doing well alone.

813
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:24,099
Maybe it s better if you come back

814
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:24,632
soon.

815
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:27,065
Kisses.

816
01:03:29,432 --> 01:03:30,099
Mommy

817
01:03:31,733 --> 01:03:32,499
Mommy!

818
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:33,666
Mommy

819
01:03:34,466 --> 01:03:35,232
Mommy!

820
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:37,132
What s wrong?

821
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:38,732
Where s Pop Pop?

822
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:39,999
Where s Pop Pop?

823
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:40,966
What?

824
01:03:40,966 --> 01:03:42,032
Pop Pop.

825
01:03:42,032 --> 01:03:42,832
Pop Pop.

826
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:46,766
Your grandpa went home.

827
01:03:46,766 --> 01:03:47,566
But why?

828
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:52,332
Because he felt betternow, and he has a home.

829
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:55,566
First you kicked Dad out, now Grandpa

830
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:57,766
and next you re going to kick us out.

831
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,933
Why did you kick me out?

832
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:04,232
I haven t kicked anyone out andI m not going to kick you out.

833
01:04:04,232 --> 01:04:06,032
You re bad, bad bad bad.

834
01:04:06,032 --> 01:04:08,299
Yeah, bad, bad bad bad.

835
01:04:08,299 --> 01:04:09,599
Come on, Cami

836
01:06:18,065 --> 01:06:22,265
and forgot the content of the environment.

837
01:06:22,265 --> 01:06:24,565
Why not be contemporary

838
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:28,765
from the tropics with local answers.

839
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:35,132
I m going to show you seriesof floor plans and elevations.

840
01:06:36,032 --> 01:06:37,232
I like that.

841
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:42,866
For example, in thisimage from the master plan

842
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:46,366
we can see the whole design andits relationship to the land.

843
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:50,066
We re definitely getting much closer.

844
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:00,299
Hi, Rita, how are you?

845
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:01,532
Anita how s it going?

846
01:07:01,532 --> 01:07:02,032
Fine.

847
01:07:02,766 --> 01:07:04,866
I brought some bread.

848
01:07:04,866 --> 01:07:06,632
That sounds delicious!

849
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:07,632
How s Dad?

850
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:10,599
I thought he was with you.

851
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:11,466
What?

852
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:17,099
Dad hasn t been with me for like a week.

853
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:18,833
I don t know, Anita.

854
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,433
I took some days off,doña Julia said I could.

855
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:25,099
That s weird.

856
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:29,132
Didn t he leave a note or anything?

857
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:32,766
I haven t seen anything, but I can check.

858
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,266
That s strange.

859
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:08,932
Excuse me, miss, I wantedto check if an older man,

860
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:11,132
a Mr. Aravena, was checked in.

861
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:14,065
He was here a few days ago, with a UTI.

862
01:08:14,065 --> 01:08:16,565
One moment, let me check.

863
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,299
You said Aravena?

864
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:23,299
Yes, Andrés Aravena Fernández.

865
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:27,065
What relation are you to the gentleman?

866
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:28,765
I m his daughter.

867
01:08:31,265 --> 01:08:36,065
Mr. Aravena came in foran oncology appointment,

868
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:37,766
but that was a few days ago now.

869
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:38,699
Oncology?

870
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:40,366
Yes

871
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:36,632
Hello, good afternoon, I mtrying to reach dean Gomez.

872
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:44,199
I m sorry. Thank you.

873
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:56,799
Hello?

874
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,833
Hello, don César, how are you?

875
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,466
Really?

876
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:09,499
That s good news.

877
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:20,233
Of course, I understand.

878
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:28,799
Yes, I just need a few daysto take care of some things.

879
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,766
No, just a few days.

880
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:39,466
A week

881
01:10:42,799 --> 01:10:43,466
OK.

882
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,366
No, thank you.

883
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:50,699
Thank you.

884
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:41,433
What do we know?

885
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:45,966
There s no one with that name,there are three unidentified bodies

886
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:48,532
and one came in yesterday,

887
01:11:48,532 --> 01:11:51,332
but it doesn t seem like it.

888
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,833
It ll be better to make sure.

889
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:59,499
Yeah, we ll just ask andit ll make us feel better.

890
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:03,232
He s only been gone like aweek, he s drinking somewhere

891
01:12:03,232 --> 01:12:04,532
or something.

892
01:12:07,232 --> 01:12:09,732
Dad is not doing so well.

893
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:15,233
The doctor said he shouldbe in chemotherapy.

894
01:12:20,499 --> 01:12:23,599
This is the one who is over 70.

895
01:12:28,032 --> 01:12:29,432
Are you ready?

896
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:36,766
Thank you.

897
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:55,566
You have keys to the house?

898
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:56,299
Yes.

899
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:58,933
Is it open?

900
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:02,065
What s with the cop?

901
01:13:02,065 --> 01:13:02,733
Weird.

902
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:22,799
Your love is escaping me

903
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:30,499
Like water through my fingers

904
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:36,065
And I can t avoid it

905
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:43,666
Though I'm dying of sadness

906
01:13:46,933 --> 01:13:50,099
I was the owner of your heart

907
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:57,566
This pain is my fault

908
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:09,899
Don t take your love away

909
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:13,466
I can see my mistake

910
01:16:04,132 --> 01:16:06,432
Hi, girls, how are you?

911
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:08,566
Good?

912
01:16:08,599 --> 01:16:11,499
It s so nice to see you here!

913
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:13,766
To what do we owe the honor?

914
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:17,933
I came to leave them herebecause something came up and

915
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:20,532
I need you guys to watch them.

916
01:16:20,532 --> 01:16:23,032
But, did you talk to Daniel?

917
01:16:23,032 --> 01:16:25,466
We re about to leave for the beach.

918
01:16:25,466 --> 01:16:26,766
Girls, do you want to go to the beach?

919
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:27,599
Yes!

920
01:16:27,765 --> 01:16:30,065
Can we bring Chocolito?

921
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:31,065
Of course.

922
01:16:33,499 --> 01:16:36,099
We d better call your Dad.

923
01:16:36,099 --> 01:16:39,332
Don t worry. I ll call him later.

924
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:41,432
We d better call him.

925

926
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:45,199

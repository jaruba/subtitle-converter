00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:03,397
(thrilling music)

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,653
(seagull calling)

3
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:17,810
(gentle music)

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,460
- It's like torching every relationship

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,377
that's ever meant a damn to you.

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,940
I left that dear, sweet
baby in his dirty diaper.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,873
And after all that, I still
ain't put that bottle down.

8
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,074
(prisoners chattering)

9
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:41,580
(bell ringing)

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,293
- This is a safe place.

11
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,865
This is a haven from the world outside.

12
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:50,403
There's no judgment here.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,880
Today is a very, very special day for him

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,900
because today he earns his 90-day chip.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,555
Thomas.

16
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:10,438
(prisoners chattering)

17
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,920
(banging)

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,423
- My name is Thomas Lewis,

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,380
and I'm an alcoholic.

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,580
- [Together] Hi, Thomas.

21
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:23,350
- Now I can speak to a
classroom full of 200 students,

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,840
but every time I come up here

23
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:30,520
it's like I'm sweatin' bullets.

24
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,953
It means 13 months ago I
was finalizing my divorce.

25
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,400
A short amount of time,
things look so different,

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,370
I feel...

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,744
Clear.

28
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:46,697
(prisoners chattering)

29
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:47,690
(bell ringing)

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm grateful my ex-wife
is finally allowing me

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,560
to see my daughter unsupervised,

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,802
which means I don't have
to look over my shoulder

33
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:57,283
at the social worker looking
at me like I'm a criminal.

34
00:01:58,692 --> 00:01:59,733
- You'll be back.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,220
- Brittany, that's my daughter's name.

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,073
Things go well then she gets
to spend the night with me.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,552
Because of you, I'm planning on

38
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,888
having ice cream with my daughter.

39
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,805
(group applauding)

40
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:42,608

41
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,831
(sniffing)

42
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:46,656
(children shouting)

43
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,459
- Dad!

44
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,691
- Hey, I know you!
- Dad!

45
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,144
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you.

46
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,144
Look at you.

47
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,520
Hey, sweetie, go ahead, go play.

49
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,060
You know what?

50
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,476
I'll let you know when it's time to go.

51
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,309
Wow.

52
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,840
These kids got so much energy.

53
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,070
They're hype, they're making me hyper.

54
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,160
You remember having this
much energy as a kid?

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,467
- No, I don't know anybody that has

56
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:18,273
as much energy as she does.

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,283
- 90-day chip, just like I promised you.

58
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,110
- I'm surprised you went through
with everything this time.

59
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,943
- Oh.

60
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,030
- I didn't mean that.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

61
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,863
Hey, Brittany!

62
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,920
Let's go, let's go!
(hands clapping)

63
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,050
I got a surprise for you at home.

64
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,160
- Bye, guys.

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,330
Ooh, a surprise?

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,180
Is it a phone?

67
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,640
- Well, how are you gonna find out

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,090
unless you get in the car?
- Yes!

69
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,923
(laughing)

70
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,930
Bye, Mom!
- Bye.

71
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,853
Have fun, honey.

72
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,260
Be sure you have her in bed by nine, okay?

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,860
- Yeah.

74
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,200
- And look, Thomas, I
didn't mean anything.

75
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,330
- No, no, look, it's fine.

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,830
Thanks again.

77
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,630
I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

this high school was again?

99
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,010
- Fairbanks, Alaska.

100
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,750
- Oh.
- My dad was in the military.

101
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,650
- Oh, okay.

102
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,810
'Cause I've just never seen a
transcript like this before.

103
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,580
- Is that gonna be a problem?

104
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,130
- No, no, it shouldn't.

105
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,180
Here's your schedule
and map of the campus.

106
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,910
And welcome.

107
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,833
- Cool, thanks.

108
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,310
- [Lady] Hey, there, how can I help you?

109
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,840
- My name is Professor Thomas Lewis.

110
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,853
For those of you in the back,

111
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,131
that is...

112
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,042
(sharpie scratching)

113
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:32,875
Professor

114
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,230
Thomas

115
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,683
Lewis.

116
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,550
Now in broad strokes we will be

117
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,630
covering various ancient
mythologies from around the world.

118
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,463
But before I get started,

119
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:51,230
I'd like to introduce you to my assistant.

120
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,970
Your TA, Leslie.

121
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,564
Please stand and tell the class
a little bit about yourself.

122
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:56,470
- Of course.

123
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,419
Hi, everybody, that's me.

124
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,430
I have known Thomas for quite a while.

125
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,880
I've taken this course before so I

126
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,820
have a pretty good idea at what I'm doing.

127
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,139
If you guys have any questions,

128
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,640
you guys need help with anything,

129
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,729
please feel free to ask me.

130
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,730
I'm here to help.

131
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,500
- Now, if you're looking
for her work hours,

132
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,663
they're in the syllabus right under mine.

133
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,760
Well, speaking of syllabus,
who in here doesn't have one?

134
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,593
Raise your hand.

135
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:21,470
Can you help me with, uh.
- Yeah, of course.

136
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,708
- In the back and I'll
take care of the front.

137
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,541
All right.

138
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:29,676
(mellow music)

139
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,560
All right.

140
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,500
Now that everybody has their syllabus,

141
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,053
let's get into this mythology.

142
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,830
Right, isn't it about a hero's journey?

143
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,960
Let's find this hero's journey.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,793
All right.

145
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,400
- You guys need help with something?

146
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,233
- Yeah.

147
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,509
- [Leslie] So I don't really
know what this is saying,

148
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:19,093
but I can go ahead and ask the
professor if he can help us.

149
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,310
Professor Lewis, can you come over here

150
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,400
and help us for a second please?

151
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,233
- Sure.

152
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,480
- Kay, they need help
with this one, if you can.

153
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,760
- Okay, well, you know what?

154
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,283
Disregard that, just go
to chapter one, all right?

155
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:30,179
- You are so smart.

156
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,523
- Oh, no, no.

157
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:33,753
You're the smart one.
(laughing)

158
00:10:33,753 --> 00:10:34,686
- I really appreciate it.

159
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,517
You know, I'm happy to
be back in your class.

160
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:37,353
- Oh, I'm happy to have you, yes.

161
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,190
- [Leslie] So I'll
catch up with you later?

162
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,623
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

(books crash)

168
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:07,485
(horn honking)
(tires screeching)

169
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,318
- Jerk!

170
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:13,561
- You okay?

171
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,700
- Yeah, I'm all right.

172
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,490
- In his defense, he
did kinda honk his horn.

173
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,140
- I can't hear nothing with
these on so maybe he did.

174
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,290
- You're in one of my classes, aren't ya?

175
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,153
- Yeah.

176
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,730
- How are you liking it so far?

177
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,483
- I mean, for the first day it was cool.

178
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:31,316
- It was cool?

179
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,450
Okay, well, that's good.

180
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,675
I see you're job hunting, huh?

181
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:37,276
- Yeah.

182
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:38,359
I need a job.

183
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,203
- Well, I don't wanna impose,

184
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,040
but do you mind if I make a suggestion?

185
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,892
- Go ahead.

186
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:47,030
- Well, a couple blocks from
here is a diner called Sal's.

187
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,863
I used to go there a couple of days

188
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,540
out of the week after class.

189
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,230
Best steak and eggs I've ever had.

190
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,430
Owner's name is Julio, great guy.

191
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,880
Could always use some help.

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,533
That's, well, of course if you don't mind

193
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,640
getting your hands dirty.

194
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,880
- No, I don't mind at all.

195
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,190
- Good.

196
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,120
Tell him Thomas Lewis sent you.

197
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,445
- All right, cool, thanks.

198
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,020
- All right.

199
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,853
And, uh.

200
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,180
I think you should look
both ways when you cross.

201
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,451
It's a good thing.

202
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,650
- All right.

203
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,483
- I'll see you in class.

204
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,316
- Yeah.

205
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,001
(crickets chirping)

206
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,680
Hi.

207
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,980
Hi.

208
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,380
Hi!

209
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,920
That's me!

210
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,963
Leslie!

211
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:35,223
I already took this class.

212
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,003
So I already know everything.

213
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:41,793
Yeah, I know it all.

214
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,603
I already know Professor Lewis.

215
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:48,991
Hmm.

216
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:53,231
(pills rattling)

217
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:03,757
(suspenseful music)

218
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,690
I'll get the ones in the back.

219
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,810
- A frequent theme in all mythologies

220
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,810
is the correlation between love and loss.

221
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,310
Heart-wrenching passion...

222
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,923
and death.

223
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,440
Hello, Ms. Jacobs.

224
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,300
Please, have a seat.

225
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,133
- Sorry.

226
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,800
- Your hair looks nice by the way.

227
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,633
- Thank you.

228
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,837
- Love and death is a constant trope

229
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,520
used in all mythologies.

230
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,210
A character is allowed to
find their one true love,

231
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,880
allowed to be with them for
a certain period of time.

232
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,950
And then, for one reason or
another, tragedy strikes,

233
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,573
and the two are torn apart.

234
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,581
If you look at the Greek story, allegory

235
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:11,581
of Orpheus and Eurydice,
or Isis and Osiris,

236
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,649
or even in the modern biblical parable

237
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,930
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

238
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,050
In it, Lot worked
tirelessly to save the city,

239
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,103
but even in the end,

240
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,743
it is his own wife that is
turned into a pillar of salt.

241
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,143
- Hey, Professor Lewis.

242
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,200
Hey.
- Hey, Tracy.

243
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,310
What can I do for you?

244
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,920
- I just wanted to say thanks again.

245
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,890
Besides saving my life last week

246
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,840
you recommending Sal's was a good thing.

247
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,600
I got the job, I started yesterday.

248
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,577
- Good, congratulations.

249
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,500
- Thank you.

250
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,447
- I guess I'm gonna have to go down there

251
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,860
and order a steak and
eggs special from you.

252
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,070
- Oh my God, I would love that.

253
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,903
I usually work

254
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:50,736
Wednesday nights--
- Hey, Tom, I had a few

255
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:53,030
questions about the papers
I was given yesterday...

256
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,040
Oh, I am so sorry.

257
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,120
I didn't realize you
guys were, I apologize.

258
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,140
I didn't mean to interrupt.

259
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,770
Go ahead and finish.

260
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,179
- No, it's cool.

261
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,723
We were finished.

262
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:07,680
- Well, congratulations again.

263
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,770
I'll see you next class.

264
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,220
- Okay.

265
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,813
- It's a cute little color though.

266
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,270
Um, yeah, so apparently I'm
gonna be here late tonight

267
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,180
between discussing a
paper with the students

268
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,310
and now I'm reading--

269
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,010
- Yes, yes, I know another long night,

270
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,270
but I really need you to
take care of this for me.

271
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,675
- All right, no problem.

272
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:26,092
- Thank you, Leslie.
- Got it.

273
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:39,476
(thrilling music)

274
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,452
(pills rattling)

275
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
(crickets chirping)

276
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:24,222
(heels clacking)

277
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,293
(thrilling music)

278
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:58,643
(suspenseful music)

279
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:04,075
(whistling)

280
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,007
(dramatic music)

281
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,285
(box crashes)

282
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:10,118
(groaning)

283
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:14,292
(hand slapping)
(screaming)

284
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,814
Help!

285
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:17,981
(choking)

286
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,501
(dramatic music)

287
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,042
(body crashes)

288
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:44,980
- I'm sure you all heard about

289
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,030
what happened to Leslie already.

290
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,803
Needless to say that today's
class will be canceled.

291
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,340
(knocking)

292
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,333
Please, come in.

293
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,740
These detectives would like
to have a word with you.

294
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,830
- Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

295
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,899
This is my card in case any
of you have heard anything

296
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,080
or have any details
regarding Leslie's murder.

297
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,610
We also have a photo of
the potential suspect

298
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,493
that was captured on the security camera.

299
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,570
- I'll make sure to make some
copies and hand them out.

300
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,130
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

301
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,660
- Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

302
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,493
- Thank you.

303
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,050
(sighs)

304
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,640
(knocking)

305
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,473
Hold on.

306
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,893
Come in.

307
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,586
- Hi, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

308
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:56,419
- No, no, no, please.

309
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,763
Come in, have a seat.

310
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,440
How can I help you?

311
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,723
- Actually, I was coming
to check up on you.

312
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,760
- Very kind of you.

313
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,763
I'm still trying to process
all of this, you know.

314
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,610
Leslie was a great person.

315
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,280
She didn't deserve what happened to her.

316
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,230
Well, listen, if it makes
you feel any better,

317
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,350
I'd like to offer you a
steak and eggs dinner on me.

318
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,760
I mean, at this point I
kinda owe you my life.

319
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,290
You gotta let me repay the debt somehow.

320
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,340
- Maybe another time.

321
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,480
Right now, I don't have
much of an appetite.

322
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,433
- Okay.

323
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,543
Well, I have another favor.

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,210
Leslie was giving me rides home from work.

325
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,260
She was so sweet to help me out for that.

326
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,610
I should have known something was wrong

327
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,946
when she didn't respond to my texts.

328
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:46,822
- I'm sorry, I had no idea

329
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,970
that you two had gotten that close.

330
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,120
- Yeah, I went to her to
ask her for help on a paper

331
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,337
and, from there, she
let me open up to her.

332
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:55,693
And she offered to help me.

333
00:19:58,318 --> 00:19:59,618
- That sounds like Leslie.

334
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,273
Always going the extra mile.

335
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm sorry, yes.
- You know what, I'm sorry.

336
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,233
I shouldn't have asked.

337
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,441
- No.
- It was inappropriate.

338
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,500
- No, no, no, it's fine.

339
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,720
What time do you need me to pick you up?

340
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,390
- Well, I get off at nine,
but if you come in at 8:30

341
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,940
I can have that steak and
eggs plate ready for you.

342
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,839
- Sounds like I'll be there at 8:30.

343
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,672
- Great.

344
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,678

347
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:38,850
- Oh, right on time, just how I like it.

348
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,323
Go ahead and sit anywhere.

349
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,753
- Okay, thanks.

350
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,240
- I've got your steak cooking right now.

351
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,050
What sides would you like?

352
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,770
- Toast and hash.

353
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:05,603
- Okay.

354
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,210
You want something a
little stronger than water?

355
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,920
I've got a little personal
stash in the back.

356
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,090
- No, water's fine.

357
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,070
- You sure?

358
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,370
It'd be our little secret.

359
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,010
- I don't drink.

360
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,113
- Never or not anymore?

361
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,163
- Anymore.

362
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,462
- Interesting.

363
00:21:24,462 --> 00:21:25,693
I'll be right back.

364
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,047
- I'm not doing this.

365
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,584
What the hell are you doing here?

366
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,101
Get up.

367
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,268
Get up and go.

368
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:41,150
All right, all right. (clears throat)

369
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,253
- Oh, food's here.

370
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,500
I had them prepare your steak medium well,

371
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,713
and your hash browns will be right out.

372
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,283
- Looks perfect.

373
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,783
- (sighs) Oh, good.

374
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:04,200
What a long, weird, twisted day, right?

375
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,343
- So, how's work coming along?

376
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,430
- It's as pleasant as
working any night shift

377
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,210
in a diner could be.

378
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm like Cinderella around here.

379
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,351
It's very glamorous.

380
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:16,983
(chuckles)

381
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,567
- So what did you do before this?

382
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,240
- Before the diner?

383
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,590
- No, before L.A.

384
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,760
I'm sorry, I saw on your resume

385
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,330
that you worked a few places out of town.

386
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,512
- I was in the military,
stationed in Germany,

387
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,880
and then I did two years in Iraq.

388
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,980
- Wow.

389
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,400
Thank you for your services.

390
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,233
- Yeah, I guess.

391
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,553
Listen, you better eat
up before that gets cold.

392
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:38,427
- Yeah.

393
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,203
(knife scratches)

394
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:53,565
- Mmm.

395
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:57,259
You were right, that is good.

396
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,099
- Oh.

397
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:05,055
(moans softly)

398
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:10,073
- You're blushing, that's cute.

399
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,670
I'm gonna check on your hash
browns and let you finish,

400
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,800
and I have a few things to do around here

401
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,050
and then we can go, okay?

Hey, thanks again, professor.

406
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,650
It's like you're always saving me.

407
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,483
- Call me Tom.

408
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,573
Don't worry about it, I
was a college student once.

409
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,180
- So, Tom.

410
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,426
Are you full?

411
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,380
- I'm stuffed.

412
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,823
Might as well try and get to a bed ASAP.

413
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,090
- Sounds like fun.

414
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,130
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

415
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,993
- You're blushing, again.

416
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,160
- Tracy, you're a beautiful girl.

417
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
- I'm 26.

418
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,650
I'm far from a girl, okay?

419
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,550
- I'm sorry, you're a beautiful woman,

420
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,608
but I'm practically twice your age.

421
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:29,441
- And?

422
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,670
- And, not to mention,
you're also my student.

423
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,650
- It's not illegal for us to
enjoy each other's time, Tom.

424
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,499
- No.

425
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,582
No, it's not.

426
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,000
But it is unethical.

427
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,383
If anyone was to find out
then I could lose my job.

428
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,740
Look, I wanna be straight with you.

429
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,640
I'm just coming off of what
was over a yearlong sabbatical

430
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,625
so I can't afford to be
a part of any scandal.

431
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,093
- I can keep a secret.

432
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,070
Listen, I...

433
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,353
think that you should reconsider, okay?

434
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,297
- Let's just go back and, oop.

435
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,597
I really can't do this,
I just got back and.

436
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,430
Wait, I.

437
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,040
Stop, stop, all right?

438
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,851
I, this can't happen.

439
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:27,790
- Well, I can feel that
you're not gay so what is it?

440
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,623
You married or divorced?

441
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,423
- Divorced.

442
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:39,170
- Well, clearly you're not
over it, but that's okay.

443
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,160
If you need help getting over it

444
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,460
you know where to find me.

445
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,717
You still love her?

446
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,920
(sighs)

447
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,753
Right.

448
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:06,071
(hip hop music)

449
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,920
- [Tom] Megan, come on!

450
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,160
I just need to talk to you for a second.

451
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,864
- Thomas, is that you?

452
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:24,230
Thomas, what the hell are you doing here?

453
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,440
- Look, I'm sorry, I've been
calling Megan on the phone.

454
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,747
She's not picking up.
- Honey, it is after midnight.

455
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:29,580
- Yes, I know, I just need

456
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,497
to talk to her for a second.
- Mom, Mom, Mom, I got it.

457
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:32,490
- What, what?
- No, I have it.

458
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,650
I got this one.
- Are you sure, honey?

459
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,557
- Yes, thank you.

460
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,410
Thomas, what the hell are you doing here?

461
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,520
- When'd your mother move in?

462
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,660
- What do you want, Thomas?

463
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,260
You know Brittany's asleep upstairs,

464
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,540
not to mention the fact I have two houses

465
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,680
to show in the morning.

466
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,580
- Look, I just need to
talk to you for a second.

467
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,413
Can I come in?

468
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,380
(groans)

469
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:57,104
(Thomas sighs)

470
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,358
(sighs)

471
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:02,608
- What do you want, Thomas?

472
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,335
(gentle music)

473
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:13,108
- I miss you.

474
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:19,531
I just want to know if we're
working towards something,

475
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,603
towards fixing us?

476
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,433
- Fixing us?

477
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,140
Is that what you've been
worried about, Thomas?

478
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,179
Fixing us?

479
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:30,230
- Look, I know I wasn't there
for you when you needed me.

480
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,570
- Look, Thomas.

481
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,270
I used to beg you to worry about fixing us

482
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,693
before we were broken.

483
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,206
But you don't even remember that

484
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:42,970
because you were too blacked out drunk.

485
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,260
- You know why I drank.

486
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,220
- Of course I know why you drank.

487
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,490
- I never blamed you for what
happened and I never will.

488
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,583
You're a good father.

489
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,830
But what I will blame you
for is what happened after

490
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,960
'cause that bottle became
your shoulder to cry on

491
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,113
instead of me.

492
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,588
Where was my shoulder, Thomas?

493
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,421
Where was my shoulder?

494
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,185
- Megan, I.

495
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:10,260
- You know what?

496
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,410
You really even shouldn't even be worried

497
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,133
about fixing us right now.

498
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,274
What you need to worry about fixing

499
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:18,580
is that little girl
that's sleeping upstairs.

500
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,020
Repairing her memory of seeing her father

501
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,120
coming in in the middle
of the day all the time

502
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,980
blacked out drunk.

503
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,280
Okay, you fix that, Thomas!

504
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,990
Fix that, okay?

505
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,823
Fix that!

506
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:37,900
(Thomas sighs)

507
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,230
- Tell Diane that I'm
sorry for waking her.

508
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,835
- Thomas.

509
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:47,835
- It's fine.

510
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,301
- Hey.

511
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:05,170
The hardest thing in the world

512
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,110
is to reject the man you love.

513
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:11,901
- Mom, I can't.

514
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:13,054
(crying)

515
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:14,054
- Oh, honey.

516
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,648
Oh, don't cry.

517
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,728
Don't cry, I know, baby.

518
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:19,643
It's gonna be all right.

519
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:22,530
It's gonna be all right, I promise, okay?

520
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:28,712
(lips smacking)
You'll be all right.

521
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:33,293
(heels clacking)

522
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,383
- Knock, knock.

523
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,743
- Tracy.

524
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,973
Ms. Jacobs.

525
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,090
- Professor Lewis.

526
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,580
- I didn't see you in class today.

527
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,952
- I couldn't show my face in there

528
00:29:50,952 --> 00:29:52,923
after what happened the other night.

529
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:00,503
(suspenseful music)

530
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,003
- You know what?

531
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,290
Why don't we just forget it?

532
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,600
- No, I was inappropriate,

533
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,550
and you were being a perfect gentleman.

534
00:30:14,266 --> 00:30:15,890
I can't forget it.

535
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,730
- Look, we all do things
we shouldn't have done.

536
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,660
Sometimes we make mistakes we regret.

537
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,810
- I didn't say I regretted anything.

538
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:28,393
I mean, you're cute, you're
smart, you're single.

539
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,040
An opportunity presented
itself and I took it.

540
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,873
- Ms. Jacobs.

541
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,420
- Listen, I'm just saying,
my offer still stands.

542
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,620
You forgot what it feels
like to be desired.

543
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:48,112
(clears throat)

544
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,755
- This has gone far beyond appropriate.

545
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,024
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

546
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:58,696
- (sighs) No.

547
00:30:58,696 --> 00:30:59,946
I'm not stupid.

548
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,423
I know you want me.

549
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,790
- It doesn't matter what I want.

550
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,490
- It's the only thing that matters.

551
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,448

- Hey.

565
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,400
Sorry I took so long.

566
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,233
Oh.

567
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,690
Ooh, I spilled something.

568
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,853
You have napkins in here?
- We have napkins right.

569
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:48,863
- What is this?

570
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,480
- Let me get that.

571
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,013
- Is this her, your ex-wife?

572
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,993
She's pretty.

573
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,417
- Yeah.

574
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,250
That's her.

575
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,550
- Oh my gosh, is this your daughter?

576
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,539
She's adorable, she's your twin.

577
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:08,420
- Let me, let me.

578
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,687
- Tom, I thought you said
you only had one kid.

579
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:14,980
(gentle music)

580
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,813
- I do.

581
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:21,447
You know, Megan named him after me.

582
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,920
I was excited to have a Junior.

583
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,663
He was a great kid.

584
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,980
Then one summer, Megan, my ex-wife,

585
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,200
she had to go out and show some houses and

586
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,870
she left me with the kids.

587
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,430
I remember Brittany,
she was taking a nap and

588
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,513
I put Junior in the crib.

589
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:56,794
I can't remember, you know.

590
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,763
Did I put him on the side,
did I put him on his back.

591
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,850
It go.

592
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,300
It goes and plays over
and over in my head,

593
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,133
but I...

594
00:34:14,783 --> 00:34:16,033
I can't remember.

595
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,853
But I remember the phone
rang, it was my publisher.

596
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,613
He was all excited about my new book.

597
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:32,470
Projected sales and all kind of nonsense.

598
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,270
Things like that.

599
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:41,590
And I remember I had
a few glasses of wine,

600
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,536
and I'm thinking like, man.

601
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:44,748
(laughs)

602
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:49,700
I don't know. (clears throat)

603
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,143
Maybe it was an hour,

604
00:34:53,336 --> 00:34:56,913
but when I looked back,
it was like an eternity.

605
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,020
'Cause when I went back in that room.

606
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:10,713
He was blue.

607
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,230
Sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS,

608
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,160
that's what they call it.

609
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,030
Happens in one in every
1000 infants and my...

610
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,317
Junior, he had to be one.

611
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:36,080
You know, two things.

612
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,275
Two things that'll haunt
me for the rest of my life

613
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:39,250
and that's...

614
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,853
Seeing my son blue in that crib.

615
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:54,210
And then having to tell his mother

616
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,073
and look her in the eyes
and tell her, her son,

617
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,653
our boy, he's gone.

618
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:06,463
He's gone.

619
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,132
You know, she never
accused me, not one time,

620
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:17,050
not one time, never said
one accusatory remark,

621
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,803
but she didn't have to, no.

622
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,237
I did that all by myself.

623
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,290
You know, I couldn't face
her, I couldn't face her.

624
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,523
I couldn't face my daughter, Brittany.

625
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,843
All I could do was drink.

626
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,003
I had to drink.

627
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,810
Malt liquor, drink that.

628
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,120
Vodka, drink that.

629
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,270
Tequila, I don't want
no shots, drink that.

630
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,410
That's all I knew that would allow me

631
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,243
to look at myself in the mirror every day.

632
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:02,987
And Megan she, ah.

633
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,013
She tried, she tried.

634
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:14,887
But all I knew was to push
her away, push everyone away.

635
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,036
Megan, she had to realize she
had to take care of herself

636
00:37:20,036 --> 00:37:23,780
and Brittany, and three DUIs later,

637
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,933
and a little stint in jail,

638
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,370
she gave me the divorce papers.

639
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,450
1:36 PM on a Thursday she gave 'em to me.

640
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:37,902
I signed them, didn't even look at it.

641
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,660
I sighed away my rights to my daughter

642
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,600
because I knew

643
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,543
they were better without me.

644
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:53,220
And I was better without
them because, you know what?

645
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,510
At least I had the bottle.

646
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,040
It took me six months
to get up enough courage

647
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,713
to go to AA and...

648
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:06,073
Another three months to stop drinking.

649
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:11,620
- So this is what you want?

650
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,183
To never drink again?

651
00:38:14,745 --> 00:38:16,573
- It's a blessing.

652
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:18,730
♪ Girl, when you're emotional ♪

653
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,890
- Yeah, bruh, so you
say she's your student?

654
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,385
Bruh, have you lost your mind?

655
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,500
- Man, you know what?

656
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,110
I knew you were gonna say that.

657
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,047
That's why I didn't wanna tell you.

658
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,483
- You're damn right I was gonna say that.

659
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,430
Because you have lost it!

660
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,425
- I didn't pursue her, she pursued me.

661
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:38,263
- (baby voice) Look, I didn't
pursue her, she pursued me.

662
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,190
I don't care who pursued who, man!

663
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,100
Wait, wait, how old is she, man?

664
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,590
Please don't tell me she 18.

665
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,673
- She not 18.

666
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,700
- Well, how old is she?

667
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,850
- Look, there's something
about this woman.

668
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,070
It's like she's exactly
what I need right now.

669
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,770
- Oh, she exactly what you
need right now, but is she 18?

670
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,910
- She's 26.

671
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,820
- What you need is a swift
kick in your ass right now.

672
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,370
That's what you need, man.

673
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,993
What if the faculty finds
out that you're sleeping

674
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:10,910
with one of your students?

675
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,963
Then what happens?

676
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,580
Maybe I get reprimanded,
a suspension, maybe worse.

677
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,090
(sighs)

678
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,003
- It's worth risking all that, huh?

679
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:21,693
- Hey, come on, man, look.

680
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,177
You're not just my AA sponsor, all right,

681
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:25,400
you're my best friend.

682
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,730
So you know everything about me.

683
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,480
This the first woman that
I've been with since Megan.

684
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Look, look, I'm talking raw,
animalistic distraction.

685
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,256
(chuckles)

686
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:40,545
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

687
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,434
Wait a minute.
- That's what we talking,

688
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:42,340
what we talking about.
- About...

689
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,826
- [Together] Raw.

690
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:46,170
Animalistic.

691
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,060
Distraction.

692
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,893
- There you go.

693
00:39:47,893 --> 00:39:49,460
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

694
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,514
Okay, I understand that,
brah, and I get it, all right?

695
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,500
But I just. (groans)

696
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,860
Just be careful, man, all right?

697
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,838
Hey, you know what they say, man.

698
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:01,380
The easiest time to start a new addiction

699
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,670
is when you're getting over a old one.

700
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,790
Food for thought.

701
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,780
- Food for thought.

702
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,091
From my AA sponsor who brings me back

703
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,186
to my old watering hole.
- Drink your water.

704
00:40:12,186 --> 00:40:15,483
Okay, all right. (laughing)

705
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,980
- Totally not a big deal.
- You sure we gonna make

706
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,813
our reservation?

707
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:26,360
- Yes, I'm sure, I just need
five minutes, 10 minutes tops.

708
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,390
I just gotta freshen up.

709
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,880
- You know you're perfect
as you are, right?

710
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,800
- Thank you.

711
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,500
Give me five minutes, go sit down.

712
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
- Hey, is this a picture of you?

713
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,247
- Yeah!

714
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,147
- Why is it I never noticed it before?

715
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,490
- [Tracy] You come in here and
you go straight to the bed.

716
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,973
You don't notice anything in here.

717
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:58,290
(laughing)

718
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,840
- When'd you take this picture?

719
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,340
- It was taken the nights my parents died.

720
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,963
- What?

721
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,810
- Not a big deal, I was five years old.

722
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,200
I barely remember anything.

723
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,590
All I know is there was a fire,
I made it out, they didn't.

724
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,250
Some jerk photographer took
my picture and there it is.

725
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,680
- You have any siblings?

726
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,513
- Nope, just me.

727
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,820
- So what happened to you
after your parents died?

728
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,850
- I moved from foster home to foster home

729
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,560
until I turned 18 and I
decided to go in the military.

730
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,213
- Why is it that I'm just
finding out about this?

731
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:42,590
- Because I was trying to avoid
these awkward conversations

732
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,440
and now that you know everything,

733
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,213
can I finish getting dressed?

734
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,280
- [Tom] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,113
- Thanks.

736
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:54,621
(sighs)

737
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:00,442
- You know I could just imagine that--

738
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:02,359
- Please, do you knock?

739
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:06,810
- What's that?

740
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,260
Come on, come on, let me see.

741
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,300
I'll open it for you.

742
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,973
Clozapine.

743
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,113
What's that for?

744
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,205
- Oh my goodness.

745
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,980
- All right, what's going on?

746
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,363
Come on, talk to me.

747
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,740
- Well, if you must know,
they're antidepressants.

748
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,680
I suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder

749
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,360
from being in the military,

750
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,683
and a doctor prescribes them for me.

751
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,103
- Okay.

752
00:42:47,103 --> 00:42:48,740
Well, I guess I'm learning
all kind of new stuff

753
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,930
about you tonight.

754
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,500
- It's not that bad really.

755
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,030
I just hate taking them
because I start feeling weird

756
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,030
and foggy, almost like
I'm not my natural self.

757
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,779
- Come here.

758
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:05,823
It's all right.

759
00:43:05,823 --> 00:43:08,437
(gentle music)

760
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:09,903
You're an amazing woman.

761
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:13,010
And I'm in awe of you right now.

762
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,503
- Really?

763
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,463
- Absolutely.

764
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:20,178
After all that you've been through,

765
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,630
pulling yourself up by the bootstraps.

766
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,653
Look, if those pills, they
make you feel like that

767
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,050
then I'm sorry, it's a shame

768
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:32,770
because I enjoy getting
to know the natural you.

769
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:33,603
- You do?

770
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:35,870
- Of course, I do.

771
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,740
- I think we should stay in tonight.

772
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:44,903
- You do?
- Yeah.

773
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,220
I have a surprise for you I've been

774
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,933
wanting to give you anyway so.

775
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:53,100
I'm gonna go get ready for the surprise.

776
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,990
You get in the bed and I'll
get your surprise ready.

777
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,083
- Surprises.

778
00:44:00,548 --> 00:44:02,173
I like surprises.

779
00:44:03,212 --> 00:44:07,701
♪ Can't live without you, yeah ♪

780
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:10,276
♪ I'll never run out on you, yeah, yeah ♪

781
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:11,109
- You like?

782
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,193
- Oh yeah, I like.

783
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,113
- Lay down.

784
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,553
- And what are you gonna do with those?

785
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,660
- These...

786
00:44:23,431 --> 00:44:26,473
are part of my surprise.

787
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:30,803
Are you nervous?

788
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,470
- I don't know, should I be?

789
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,680
- No.

790
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,873
Maybe a little.

791
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,450
- So.

792
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,037
- You ready for the surprise?

793
00:44:44,037 --> 00:44:45,452
- I hope it has nothing
to do with a feather

794
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:48,533
because it's unmanly how ticklish I am.

795
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:53,680
- (whispers) It's not feathers.

796
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,883
Okay, close your eyes.

797
00:44:56,336 --> 00:44:58,130
(dramatic music)

798
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,750
Open your mouth.
- Hmm, what?

799
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,313
- Open your mouth.

800
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:03,843
Open it.

801
00:45:05,253 --> 00:45:07,336
(coughs)

802
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,930
- What are you doing?

803
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,120
- I'm being your serpent in the tree.

804
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,720
You know you want it.

805
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,330
And I won't tell anyone,
especially your ex.

806
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,363
- No, stop.

807
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,440
- Why, because of some AA pledge?

808
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,882
They don't know anything.

809
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:27,230
They just tell you to suppress your urges.

810
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,553
Life is about giving in.

811
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,810
You can be free here.

812
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,463
I want you to be your true self.

813
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,763
So have a drink with me.

814
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:38,915
I won't tell anyone.

815
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:43,697
(slow tempo hip hop music)

816
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,338
(suspenseful music)

817
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,333
(pill rattles)

818
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:32,545
(pills rattle)

819
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:57,003
(birds chirping)

820
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,563
- Hey.

821
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,020
What you doin' out here?

822
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,833
I was looking all over for you.

823
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,163
- Did you get my note?

824
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,510
- No, I didn't get your note but

825
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,310
I saw you through the window.

826
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,143
- This is amazing.

827
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,513
I come out here.

828
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,063
I like to feel the wind.

829
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,090
This is my safe place.

830
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:00,840
Clear out all the noise in my head.

831
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:09,763
- Well, your safe place is
not that good for my migraine.

832
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,803
- You got a hangover?

833
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,700
- Yeah, I guess you could call it that.

834
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,640
I need some asprin or something.

835
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:23,384
What time you got?

836
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,533
- 12:42.

837
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:30,366
- Ah.

838
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,110
I gotta get outta here.

839
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:37,723
- What's wrong?

840
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,250
- I'm late.

841
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,083
- Late for what?

842
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,582
- Well.

843
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:44,513
I need to pick up my daughter

844
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:47,290
and take her to swimming lessons.

845
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,920
And, well, it's gonna take
me at least 30 minutes

846
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,576
to go home, change up,
I need to take a shower.

847
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:54,650
- All right, well, let me get dressed.

848
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,530
I'll go with you.

849
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,330
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, nah.

850
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,583
I'm good, I'm good.

851
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,403
Look, I couldn't find my
phone, where'd you put it?

852
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,030
- It's on the side of the bed.

853
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,900
Why is it that you don't want
me to be around your daughter?

854
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,410
It's like you don't want me
to meet her or something.

855
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,773
Why?
- Come on, really?

856
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,190
Because.

857
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,023
- Because?

858
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,320
Because is not an answer.

859
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,193
Because why?

860
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,577
- It's a little too early for
all of that, don't you think?

861
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:24,330
I mean, I got a 10-year-old
daughter who's already

862
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,880
wondering why her daddy's
not there tucking her in.

863
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,720
Now she's gonna wonder why
I'm 30 minutes late or more

864
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,750
just to take her to swimming lessons.

865
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,633
Last thing I need to do is
add another adult in the mix

866
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:41,180
so she has more questions to ask, okay?

867
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,732
- No, it's not okay.

868
00:49:43,732 --> 00:49:47,037
- It's gonna have to be, 'cause
you're not gonna meet her.

869
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:53,365
Come on, give me a kiss, I gotta go.

870
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,974
Come on.

871
00:49:54,974 --> 00:49:55,807
Come here.

872
00:49:58,316 --> 00:50:00,800
(lips smacking)

873
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,633
All right.

874
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,370
Talk to you later, all right?

875
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,053
I need to get outta here.

876
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,819
(knocking)

877
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,700
- Thomas, you're late.

878
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,290
Brittany, your dad's here!

879
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,320
I missed an appointment because of you.

880
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,530
- Megan, I'm sorry, I got caught up.

881
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,100
- Dad, you're late.

882
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,450
You made Mom miss an
appointment with a new client.

883
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,150
- You sound just like your mother.

884
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,610
Don't let it happen again.

885
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,853
And are you still gonna take me swimming?

886
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,320
- Well?

887
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,201
- Brittany, go get the swimsuit

888
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:41,672
your grandmother gave you, okay?

889
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:42,505
- Yes!

890
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,080
- Megan, I just wanna
thank you again for this.

891
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,193
I know you ain't have to do this.

892
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,710
- What's going on with you, you okay?

893
00:50:56,315 --> 00:51:00,253
- Well, I'm worse than
some, better than most.

894
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,350
- And what is this?

895
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,183
- What?

896
00:51:07,183 --> 00:51:09,528
- You're more dressed down than normal.

897
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:12,248
- Come on, Dad, let's go.

898
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:13,120
Come on!

899
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,433
- [Megan] You guys have fun.

900
00:51:18,754 --> 00:51:21,013
(phone ringing)

901
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:22,503
- [Brittany] Bye, Mom!

902
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:23,336
- Bye, honey!

903
00:51:23,336 --> 00:51:25,364
- Well, I'll have her call you

904
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:27,112
before she goes to sleep tonight.

905
00:51:27,112 --> 00:51:31,379
- Okay.
(lips smacking)

906
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,055
(engine revving)

907
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,970
- [Tom] Let's go, my
little fish, let's go.

908
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:39,720
(engine revving)

909
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:43,930
(TV chatter)

910
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,760
- [Man] He's given a
whole lot of speeches.

911
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,140
And we have seen that the speeches

912
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,980
and the reality don't match up.

913
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,410
- [Woman] So the basketball tournament

914
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,150
is this weekend at three,
and Kim's gonna come with us.

915
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,183
- [Man] I cannot wait.

916
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:59,850
(phone buzzing)

917
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:03,900
(phone beeping)

918
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,912
- [Woman] Oh, please, Scott
is never gonna settle down

919
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:07,512
with a model.

920
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:09,929
(TV chatter)

921
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:12,920
(clears throat)

922
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,750
- [Tracy] Okay, Tom, maybe
I overreacted a little

923
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,250
bit this morning.

924
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,450
Just call me back, okay?

925
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,910
Silence is not how we solve problems, Tom.

926
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,233
Call me back.

927
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,991
(suspenseful music)

928
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,570
Who the hell do you think you are?

929
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,633
How dare you ignore me?

930
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,513
I can destroy you.

931
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:01,211
(sighs)

932
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:05,934
(TV chatter)

933
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:09,453
(crickets chirping)

934
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,231
(knocking)

935
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,064
(soft jazz music)

936
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,893
I'll just invite myself in.

937
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,880
- Look, I don't wanna argue
with you again, all right?

938
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,540
- Me either, crazy.

939
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,930
That's not what I'm here for.

940
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,293
I came to give you a gift.

941
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:38,260
- What's this?

942
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,640
- It was my father's.

943
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,933
It was the only thing
that survived the fire.

944
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,223
(suspenseful music)

945
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,220
- Listen, I can't take this.

946
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:54,160
- Listen, I really, really
overreacted the other day.

947
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,220
You don't deserve that.

948
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,430
So I wanted you to have
this so you could know

949
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,200
how much you mean to me.

950
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,323
It's an apology gift.

951
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,663
- Look, Tracy, I accept your
apology but I cannot take this.

952
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:11,310
Are you just gonna forget about
all the 100 calls you made?

953
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,420
And then the
(phone ringing)

954
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,923
30-something voice
messages you left me, huh?

955
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,853
Hold on.

956
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,077
Hey, baby, what's goin' on, Brittany?

957
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:22,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, slow down.

958
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,360
No, right, look, I can't understand you.

959
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,513
No, what, Diane, what's going on?

960
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,290
Oh, oh, okay, oh my god.

961
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:33,906
All right, all right, okay.

962
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:35,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way right now.

963
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,650
Okay, I'm leaving, bye.

964
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,730
- What's going on?

965
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,693
- Megan was in an accident,
she's in the hospital.

966
00:54:43,537 --> 00:54:44,970
- [Tracy] Is Brittany okay?

967
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,810
- Yeah, she was with her grandmother.

968
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:47,643
I have to go.

969
00:54:47,643 --> 00:54:48,476
- We can go to the hospital together.

970
00:54:48,476 --> 00:54:50,290
- No, no, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

971
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,470
You can't come with me, all right?

972
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,303
We've been over this.

973
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:54,070
- I'll go with you.
- No, you, no, no.

974
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,840
I gotta go to the
hospital, you gotta leave.

975
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,420
- Well, we're not finished here.

976
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,806
I'll just wait here until you get back.

977
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:02,920
- I don't have time for this, all right?

978
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,497
Look, I gotta go, lock
up the door behind you!

979
00:55:14,096 --> 00:55:16,596
(sucks teeth)

980
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,493
- Thomas, Thomas!

981
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,353
- [Brittany] Dad!

982
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:29,178
- Oh, come here.

983
00:55:29,178 --> 00:55:30,073
- Mommy's hurt.

984
00:55:31,473 --> 00:55:32,800
Really bad.

985
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,400
- I know, baby, I know.

986
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,450
- Ah, sorry, she just came outta surgery.

987
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:43,724
She had some broken bones,
internal bleeding and.

988
00:55:43,724 --> 00:55:44,673
Oh, honey, I know.

989
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:46,970
- All right, baby.

990
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,500
- They caught all that
in time but right now

991
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,350
they're just worried about
the swelling in the brain

992
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,983
so they had to put her in
a medically-induced coma.

993
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,407
- Wait, wait, ho.

994
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,113
Coma?
- Yeah.

995
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,810
They don't know how long it's gonna take,

996
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,327
like days, weeks, I don't know.

997
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:04,900
We just gotta, we just
gotta hope and pray.

998
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,530
- Hey, hey, Daddy's right here.

999
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:11,593
All right, hey, hey, it's okay.

1000
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,770
Stay with Nana.

1001
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,727
- It's gonna be fine.

1002
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:17,572
Oh, honey, don't cry.

1003
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:19,822
Please don't cry, you're
gonna make Nana cry.

1004
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:25,022
(monitor beeping)

1005
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:28,620
(crying)

1006
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,453
- Okay.

1007
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,307
(siren wailing)

1008
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:42,305
(monitor beeping)

1009
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:47,243
- Thank you.

1010
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,911
(snoring softly)

1011
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:05,025
(sighs)

1012
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,383
Thomas.

1013
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,213
Thomas.

1014
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,623
Good morning.

1015
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:25,810
(grunts)

1016
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,010
- I must have dosed off.

1017
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:29,370
- Here, honey.

1018
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,510
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1019
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,463
- What time is it?

1020
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:35,670
I need to get Brittany to school.

1021
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:37,630
- Already taken care of, my love.

1022
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:38,463
- Thank you.

1023
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,180
- Ain't nothin' but a thing.

1024
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:43,463
We all family here, honey.

1025
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,610
- And thanks for this.

1026
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:52,103
- Why don't you just go on home?

1027
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,880
I'll call you if anything changes.

1028
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,563
- Ngh-ngh.

1029
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,423
I can't get any rest with
her in here, not like this.

1030
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,350
- Well, you're not gonna do her no good

1031
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,999
if you end up in the bed
right beside her, honey.

1032
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:12,860
Please, listen to me,
go home, take a shower.

1033
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,380
Lay your head on the pillow
and get some winks of sleep

1034
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,710
and then come back here
nice and refreshed.

1035
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,523
You're gonna do yourself
and Megan a favor.

1036
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,260
- Maybe you're right.

1037
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,310
- You know I'm right.

1038
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,503
- Okay. (clears throat)

1039
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,573
Diane.

1040
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,634
You know I must have
apologized to your daughter

1041
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,003
over 1000 times for what
I did to our marriage.

1042
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:57,803
But, um.

1043
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,083
I know after our divorce
you had to step up.

1044
00:59:03,578 --> 00:59:05,028
I never got to say thank you.

1045
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,073
I'm sorry.

1046
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,793
- Matthew 18: 21 and 22.

1047
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:18,623
- I'm not familiar.

1048
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,571
- Then came Peter to him and said Lord,

1049
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:28,340
how oft shall my brother sin against me

1050
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,483
before I forgive him?

1051
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,793
Till seven times?

1052
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,160
Jesus sayeth unto him,
I do not say unto thee

1053
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:43,833
till seven times, but
until 70 times seven.

1054
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:49,920
I know you were sorry
as soon as it happened,

1055
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,893
and I forgave you way back then,

1056
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,853
but it's way past time
you forgive yourself.

1057
00:59:58,107 --> 00:59:58,940
Please.

1058
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:00,963
Oh.

1059
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,760
- I gotta go, I'll be back.
- I know.

1060
01:00:18,101 --> 01:00:20,934
(monitor beeping)

1061
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:36,885
(dramatic music)

1062
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,110
- Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.

1063
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,710
What are you doing here?

1064
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,920
- How was the hospital?

1065
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,753
How's Brittany?

1066
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,960
- What have you been doing?

1067
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,100
- This.

1068
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,300
I moved this chair here
so I could be right here

1069
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,690
when you got in.

1070
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,730
- Fine, get up, come on.

1071
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,220
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1072
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:00,233
Come on, really?

1073
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:05,840
Moving all my stuff around,
rearranging my stuff.

1074
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,060
I mean, what?

1075
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:10,069
You've been here for the last
few days while I've been away?

1076
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:13,210
- I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

1077
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,363
How's your ex-wife, did she die?

1078
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,120
- What'd you say?

1079
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,213
Why would you say

1080
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:22,590
something like that?
- (sighs) Oh, Tom.

1081
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:23,810
Because I care.

1082
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,837
I care, Tom.

1083
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:28,734
I was worried about you.

1084
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:30,633
I was really worried about Brittany.

1085
01:01:33,846 --> 01:01:36,450
- Hey, stop, no really, just stop.

1086
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:37,430
- What?

1087
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,050
- Look, I.

1088
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,850
I just can't entertain this anymore.

1089
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,967
- What are you saying, Tom?

1090
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,417
- I'm saying that we're done.

1091
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,300
This is it.

1092
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,900
We're through, Tracy, all right?

1093
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,850
I don't have the energy or the willingness

1094
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,083
to even entertain your antics anymore.

1095
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,430
- No.

1096
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:58,727
- Yes.
- No.

1097
01:01:58,727 --> 01:02:00,001
No!

1098
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,034
No.

1099
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:02,120
No, no.

1100
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,400
- Look, the only priority I
have right now is to my family.

1101
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,940
All right, not to anyone
else, and that includes you.

1102
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,640
- Was your family a priority
when you killed your son?

1103
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:15,172
(dramatic music)

1104
01:02:15,172 --> 01:02:16,673
I didn't mean that.

1105
01:02:16,673 --> 01:02:19,470
I didn't mean that, I'm sorry.

1106
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,670
I was outta line.
- Just stop.

1107
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,040
I was outta line, I didn't mean that.

1108
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,024
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

1109
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:24,560
- Look, get out.
- I'm sorry.

1110
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,393
I didn't mean to say that.
- Look, get out!

1111
01:02:25,393 --> 01:02:27,038
- We can talk about it, Tom.
- No, get.

1112
01:02:27,038 --> 01:02:29,221
- Let's talk about this.
- Look, get out, let's go.

1113
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:30,312
- We can talk about this!
- I said get out.

1114
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,145
I want you out!

1115
01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:32,998
- You're hurting me!
- Look, out!

1116
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,387
I want you out of here right--
- No, no!

1117
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:35,769
Tom!

1118
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:36,602
- Get out!

1119
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:37,607
- [Tracy] Tom!

1120
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:38,524
- And stay the hell away from me!

1121
01:02:38,524 --> 01:02:41,013
- [Tracy] We need to talk about this!

1122
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:41,846
Tom!

1123
01:02:45,267 --> 01:02:46,100
Please!

1124
01:02:48,218 --> 01:02:49,181

01:04:01,429 --> 01:04:03,179
- Brittany needs you.

1143
01:04:06,484 --> 01:04:07,733
I need you.

I love you so much.

1148
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:29,702
- Megan.

1149
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,393
She's awake.

1150
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:33,203
Baby.

1151
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:36,880
- Oh, thank God.
- She's awake.

1152
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,880
- Thank God.

1153
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,603
- Nurse, nurse, she's awake!

1154
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:46,890
- [Diane] Thank God, thank God.

1155
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,703
- Oh, I just never wanna let you go.

1156
01:04:54,703 --> 01:04:55,536
- I love you, Mom.

1157
01:04:55,536 --> 01:04:57,313
- I love you too, baby.

1158
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,250
- Mom, can I get some candy?
(dramatic music)

1159
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:04,380
- [Megan] Sure, you want
Grandma or Daddy to go with you?

1160
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,270
- [Brittany] No, I know where it is.

1161
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:08,610
- You sure you don't want
Dad to just come help you

1162
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,920
push the buttons?

1163
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,270
- [Brittany] Dad, I got it.

1164
01:05:12,513 --> 01:05:15,868
- Come here, baby, I'll
give you some change.

1165
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:17,340
I got $5.

1166
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,610
Machine's right around the
corner, and she'll be fine.

1167
01:05:19,610 --> 01:05:20,760
- Thanks, Grandma.

1168
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,950
- [Megan] Hurry back, sweet pea.

1169
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:22,783
- Okay, Mom.

1170
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:24,600
- You're so grown.

1171
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,530
- You sure you weren't speeding?

1172
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,693
- No, Thomas, I don't speed.

1173
01:05:28,693 --> 01:05:31,193
I usually have the baby so no.

1174
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:35,407
- Wow.

1175
01:05:36,773 --> 01:05:39,620
And you don't remember anything else.

1176
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:40,453
- No.

1177
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:46,756
(candy rattles)

1178
01:05:51,035 --> 01:05:52,930
(dramatic music)

1179
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:54,140
- Hey, Brittany.

1180
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,790
- This one guy cutting me off and

1181
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:01,600
I swerved and tried to hit the
brakes and they didn't work.

1182
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,490
Next thing I know, I'm slamming
into a concrete barrier.

1183
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,323
Then nothing.

1184
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,080
- What's taking her so
long to get some candy?

1185
01:06:14,302 --> 01:06:16,040
There you go.

1186
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,470
You're finally back.

1187
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,080
Let's see what you got.

1188
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:27,533
(suspenseful music)

1189
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:28,913
- Where'd you get this?

1190
01:06:28,913 --> 01:06:30,363
- Tracy gave it to me.

1191
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,493
- Tracy?

1192
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,121
- Dad.

1193
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:39,260
Why did she say she's my stepmom?

1194
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:45,010
- Baby, I need you to
stay with your grandma.

1195
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:45,843
- Okay.

1196
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,793
- Sorry.

1197
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,690
- [Hatch] Just the man we're looking for.

1198
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:15,550
- What's this about?

1199
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,802
- You need to come with me.
- Get your hands offa me!

1200
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:19,946
- You don't remember
us from the university?

1201
01:07:19,946 --> 01:07:21,831
'Cause we remember you.

1202
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:22,945
- What's this about?

1203
01:07:22,945 --> 01:07:23,778
- You need to come with u--

1204
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,993
- Get your hands off of me!

1205
01:07:25,993 --> 01:07:27,910
I got a ex-wife who just got out of a coma

1206
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,933
a couple hours ago,
I'm not going anywhere.

1207
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,460
- Fine.

1208
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,492
You want to explain to her
why we got an anonymous tip

1209
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:38,240
stating that a certain
professor who's currently

1210
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,150
under a murder investigation

1211
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,810
might have also cut his
ex-wife's brake lines?

1212
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:42,783
- What?

1213
01:07:42,783 --> 01:07:44,890
- You're coming with us.

1214
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,660
- Tracy Jacobs, all
right, I keep saying it.

1215
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:47,800
Tracy Jacobs.

1216
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,100
Maybe you're not spelling it right.

1217
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,580
- We ran her name and all the
other information you gave us

1218
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,770
and nothing came up.

1219
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:53,800
- What about her apartment?

1220
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,230
- We sent a unit to the address,

1221
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,620
but the landlord told our officers

1222
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,510
that nobody lives there by that name.

1223
01:07:58,510 --> 01:07:59,980
- That's impossible.

1224
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,003
Look, I've been there, I slept there.

1225
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:04,050
- And you're saying this
fantasy woman of yours

1226
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,380
is your ticked off girlfriend?

1227
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,213
- Was.

1228
01:08:06,213 --> 01:08:08,410
- Was your girlfriend and student.

1229
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,546
- Look, look, you asked me
who I thought it might be,

1230
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,690
all right, I'm telling you.

1231
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,717
No person comes up to a child and says,

1232
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:16,000
"I'm gonna be your stepmom."

1233
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,100
Are you serious?

1234
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:17,933
- That's right.

1235
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:18,766
You felt threatened because she

1236
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,220
gave your daughter a bracelet.

1237
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,088
- That's right.

1238
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:23,307
Look, I know how crazy it sounds.

1239
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,720
- It sounds like a load of crap.

1240
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,510
If you ask me, you're the
one with everything to lose.

1241
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,160
Ex-wife, ex-girlfriend,
cushy teaching job.

1242
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,580
- Fine, y'all don't wanna
listen to me, all right.

1243
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,410
I'm telling you there's
something off about this woman.

1244
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,196
If my ex-wife brake lines were cut

1245
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:38,193
then that's who you should be looking at.

1246
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:42,204
(monitor beeping)

1247
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,643
(dramatic music)

1248
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:09,566
(dramatic music)

1249
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,951
(coughing)

1250
01:09:12,951 --> 01:09:14,506
- What is this?

1251
01:09:14,506 --> 01:09:16,756
(coughing)

1252
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,634
What is this?

1253
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:21,025
What is this?

1254
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:22,759
(screaming)

1255
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,043
Take this.

1256
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:24,876
- [Nurse] It's okay.

1257
01:09:24,876 --> 01:09:27,250
- [Tom] Megan, I would never do that.

1258
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,530
- So this woman has been
around our daughter?

1259
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,180
- No, all right?

1260
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,530
I never brought her around Brittany.

1261
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,683
She must have followed me
to a visit or something.

1262
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,460
- Do you love her?

1263
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,810
- Just because I slept with
her doesn't mean I love her.

1264
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,643
I love you.

1265
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:47,966
- Then get me outta here.

1266
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,860
Mom, I want to go home.

1267
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:50,693
- I know, baby, I know.

1268
01:09:50,693 --> 01:09:51,740
- Get me outta here, now!
- I know, honey.

1269
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,380
we're gonna just--
- No, get me outta here!

1270
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,870
- Please, just wait a second, all right?

1271
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:02,680
- All right.

1272
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,670
Diane.
- Yeah?

1273
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:04,603
- Can you pick up Brittany from school

1274
01:10:04,603 --> 01:10:06,100
and keep her with you tonight?

1275
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:06,933
- Absolutely.

1276
01:10:06,933 --> 01:10:09,035
All right, I'll leave now.

1277
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,793
All right, baby, I love you.

1278
01:10:10,793 --> 01:10:12,469
- I love you too, Mom.

1279
01:10:12,469 --> 01:10:13,773
- All right.

1280
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,203
Call you later!
- Okay!

1281
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,893
- [Brittany] Do you think
Mom's gonna be okay?

1282
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:22,800
- Mm-hmm.

1283
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,400
I do believe she's gonna be okay, honey.

1284
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,190
You're gonna come to my place,

1285
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:30,773
and we're gonna have some
smores and hot chocolate,

1286
01:10:30,773 --> 01:10:34,113
and stay up late and carry on.

1287
01:10:34,113 --> 01:10:35,446
- Hey, Brittany!

1288
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,675
- Oh, can I go play with him please?

1289
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:38,650
- Yeah, baby, you want me to hold that?

1290
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,591
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1291
01:10:39,591 --> 01:10:41,341
- Come on.
- Have fun!

1292
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:46,780
(children chattering)

1293
01:10:59,187 --> 01:11:00,187
- You're it!

1294
01:11:05,777 --> 01:11:08,610
(Brittany laughs)

1295
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:19,571
- Brittany?

1296
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,853
Brittany?

1297
01:11:27,562 --> 01:11:28,395
Brittany?

1298
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:30,880
Brittany!

1299
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,580
Did you see Brittany, honey?

1300
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,220
Did you see a little girl, you
were just playing with her.

1301
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,050
- I don't, she was here but I don't.

1302
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,246
She's not here anymore.
- She's not here.

1303
01:11:37,246 --> 01:11:38,850
Brittany!

1304
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:40,412
- Brittany!

1305
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:41,329
- Brittany!

1306
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:43,059
Brittany!

1307
01:11:43,059 --> 01:11:43,892
- [Boy] Brittany!

1308
01:11:43,892 --> 01:11:45,833
- [Diane] Oh my God, where did she go?

1309
01:11:46,937 --> 01:11:48,490
- Brittany!
- Yes, is this 911?

1310
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,133
Yeah, my granddaughter's missing.

1311
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,047
- I was on the playground the whole time.

1312
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,610
- Ms. Shibley, what happened to you?

1313
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,610
- As I said before, she was
playing with these little kids,

1314
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,630
those little kids, and I
turn around for two seconds

1315
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:03,210
to use my phone, then I
turn back and she was gone.

1316
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,260
She was just gone!

1317
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,436
I don't understand!

1318
01:12:06,436 --> 01:12:07,833
- Do you know any of these
kid that she's playing with?

1319
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:09,940
- No, but they seemed to know her.

1320
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:10,773
- Did you call her parents?

1321
01:12:10,773 --> 01:12:11,606
- I did.

1322
01:12:11,606 --> 01:12:14,580
They're coming home from the hospital.

1323
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,413
- Thank you for your time.

1324
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:17,358
If we need any more information,
we'll give you a call.

1325
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:18,294
- Okay. (crying)

1326
01:12:18,294 --> 01:12:19,294
- Thank you.

1327
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:23,001
(sobbing)

1328
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,170
- And you have no idea
of where our daughter is?

1329
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,430
- We're doing the best we can, sir.

1330
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,730
- The best you can?

1331
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,174
The best you can, let me tell
you what the best you can

1332
01:12:29,174 --> 01:12:30,050
would have been.

1333
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:31,460
You out there looking for that woman

1334
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,300
instead of sitting down questioning me!

1335
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,500
- Thomas.
- No, no, no.

1336
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,610
This is BS.

1337
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:38,833
Find my daughter!

1338
01:12:45,799 --> 01:12:47,489
- I apologize.
- No, you're family's going

1339
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:48,570
through a very tough time.

1340
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:49,533
We understand.

1341
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,533
(suspenseful music)

1342
01:12:56,181 --> 01:12:57,098
- Brittany!

1343
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:00,540
Brittany!

1344
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:08,269
(crashing)

1345
01:13:08,269 --> 01:13:09,794
(foot smashing)
(lock rattling)

1346
01:13:09,794 --> 01:13:11,430
Brittany!

1347
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,830
Brittany, where are you?

1348
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,663
Brittany!

1349
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:17,092
Brittany!

1350
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:19,554
Brittany!

1351
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:23,097
Brittany, where are you?

1352
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:24,206
Brittany.

1353
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:25,919
(whimpering)

1354
01:13:25,919 --> 01:13:28,168
Come on, baby, baby, come here.

1355
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:31,169
It's okay, it's okay,
all right, all right.

1356
01:13:31,169 --> 01:13:32,785
Come on, come here, come here.

1357
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:34,483
Come on, I got you.

1358
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:35,589
I got you.
(siren wailing)

1359
01:13:35,589 --> 01:13:37,427
Here you go, all right, all right.

1360
01:13:37,427 --> 01:13:38,970
Are you hurt?

1361
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,563
Are you hurt, baby, huh?

1362
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:41,550
- My arm.

1363
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,743
- Your, okay, okay, okay.

1364
01:13:43,743 --> 01:13:45,890
All right, okay, all right.

1365
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:46,723
Daddy's here.

1366
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,920
She's okay, baby, yeah.

1367
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,984
She's just a bit shaken up.

1368
01:13:51,984 --> 01:13:54,146
- Oh, thank God.

1369
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:56,290
Thank God you found her.

1370
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,690
- I'm bringing her home now.

1371
01:13:58,846 --> 01:14:00,693
Listen, sorry about this.

1372
01:14:02,544 --> 01:14:03,580
- Hurry, please.
(dramatic music)

1373
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,195
- I'll see you soon.

1374
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:06,028
- [Megan] Hurry.

1375
01:14:06,028 --> 01:14:08,994
(dramatic music)

1376
01:14:08,994 --> 01:14:09,827
(fist smashing)
(Megan groaning)

1377
01:14:09,827 --> 01:14:11,302
(wheelchair rattles)

1378
01:14:11,302 --> 01:14:12,648
(thrilling music)

1379
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,898
(groaning)

1380
01:14:21,139 --> 01:14:23,075
(objects crashing)

1381
01:14:23,075 --> 01:14:25,825
(women grunting)

1382
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:28,869
(elbow smashing)

1383
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:29,702
(women grunting)

1384
01:14:29,702 --> 01:14:30,943
(table crashes)

1385
01:14:30,943 --> 01:14:33,693
(women grunting)

1386
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,824
(foot smashes)
(groaning)

1387
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:43,241
(whimpering)

1388
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,823
(vase smashes)

1389
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:58,202
(grunting)

1390
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:06,249
(wheelchair rattles)

1391
01:15:09,589 --> 01:15:11,228
(grunting)
(head smashing)

1392
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:13,895
(body thudding)

1393
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,490
- Hi, young lady, I'm Detective Daily.

1394
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,323
- Oh, come on, come on.

1395
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:30,723
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1396
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:32,920
Mr. Lewis, it would be best if we could

1397
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,310
take Brittany to the station
tonight and get her statement.

1398
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:36,900
Now, I realize this is a
traumatic experience for her but--

1399
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,170
- I've had enough of you guys.

1400
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,860
The only place I'm taking my daughter

1401
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,785
is to be home with her mother.

1402
01:15:41,785 --> 01:15:42,903
Now, if she's feeling up to it tomorrow

1403
01:15:42,903 --> 01:15:44,590
then I'll bring her by the police station.

1404
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,033
She'll give you a statement then.

1405
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:48,664
- Understood.

1406
01:15:48,664 --> 01:15:49,773
- Thank you.

1407
01:15:55,558 --> 01:15:56,891
All right, baby.

1408
01:15:58,386 --> 01:16:00,719
We're going home, all right?

1409
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:02,867
All right.

1410
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,230
(tape crackling)

1411
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,590
- You think I wanted to be this person?

1412
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:15,020
You think I wanted to be like this, again?

1413
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:15,883
Do you?

1414
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,700
Answer me!

1415
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,999
(hand slapping)

1416
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:22,832
(thrilling music)

1417
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,866
- How's it goin'?

1418
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:40,463
(dramatic music)

1419
01:16:40,463 --> 01:16:42,699
Brittany!

1420
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:43,532
Brittany!

1421
01:16:44,384 --> 01:16:45,217
Wait, wait, don't go in there.

1422
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,080
Don't go in there.
- Why, why?

1423
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,420
- I know women like you.

1424
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,793
Controlling, manipulative,
just like my mom.

1425
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,123
We fixed her too.

1426
01:16:56,018 --> 01:16:58,860
But you're a bit more stubborn, see.

1427
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,070
You didn't die in the car.

1428
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,756
But that's okay.

1429
01:17:02,756 --> 01:17:04,676
(muffled screams)

1430
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:05,620
- I have an emergency.

1431
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,590
I need you to send the
police to my address.

1432
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,430
I think there's an
officer down, all right?

1433
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:11,920
Here, you give them
your address, all right?

1434
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,246
Go in the car, lock the door.

1435
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:14,713
Lock the door, sweetie!

1436
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,913
- You're gonna drown.

1437
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:22,867
(thrilling music)

1438
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:24,830
(muffled screams)

1439
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,663
- Megan.

1440
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:31,518
- You're daughter is gonna call me Mom.

1441
01:17:31,518 --> 01:17:33,215
(muffled screams)
- Megan!

1442
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,357
Megan.

1443
01:17:34,357 --> 01:17:35,190
Megan.

1444
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:36,023
- Stop!
- Tracy.

1445
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:37,170
- Don't come any closer,
I swear to God I'll--

1446
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:38,756
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1447
01:17:38,756 --> 01:17:41,070
Come on, Tracy.

1448
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:42,750
Just please let her go.

1449
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,080
There's still enough time,
the police aren't here.

1450
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,913
All right?

1451
01:17:45,913 --> 01:17:47,090
It doesn't have to be like this.

1452
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:48,830
It doesn't have to be like this.

1453
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,870
Just let her go, okay?

1454
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:53,423
You don't deserve this and
neither does she, okay?

1455
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:58,890
If you let her go, me and
you, we can get outta here.

1456
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:01,430
- You and me, we can leave together?

1457
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:04,560
- That's right, just let her go.

1458
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,543
Come on, let's go.

1459
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,813
- You think I'm stupid.

1460
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:15,430
You and me and Brittany,
we can never be happy

1461
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,710
as long as she's still in the picture.

1462
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,748
She has to die.

1463
01:18:18,748 --> 01:18:20,249
- No!
(siren wailing)

1464
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:22,060
No, no!
(water splashing)

1465
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,778
- [Officer] Freeze!

1466
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:25,480
Get on the ground, now!

1467
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,823
Put your hands up!

1468
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:35,987
(whistling)

1469
01:18:35,987 --> 01:18:38,750
- [Tom] So you're saying
that there were new findings?

1470
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,583
- Yes, sir.

1471
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:40,500
For one, the woman who attacked you two,

1472
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,740
her name isn't Tracy
Jacobs, it's Laura Santiago.

1473
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:46,120
She got herself picked up out
of Texas for jumping bail.

1474
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:46,953
Apparently she's been locked up

1475
01:18:46,953 --> 01:18:48,550
down there since she was only 12.

1476
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:51,820
- We had given them a
call to let them know

1477
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,790
she was arrested.

1478
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,120
They were more than happy to
come down and take her back.

1479
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,430
She'd only been out for six
months when she met you.

1480
01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:00,040
- What did she do to get
arrested in the first place?

1481
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,350
- The story that she told
you wasn't too far off.

1482
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:04,000
Her parents did die in a fire,

1483
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,740
but it was she and her brother who set it.

1484
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,343
- Her brother?

1485
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,676
(whistling)

1486
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,770
- She wasn't an only child.

1487
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:17,650
Remember the apartment was
under an Alfred Santiago?

1488
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,530
That's Laura's older brother.

1489
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,810
It took a lotta red tape to
get their juvenile records

1490
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,000
because they were sealed
by the arresting state.

1491
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,660
Once we got the judge to unseal them,

1492
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,340
it cleared everything up.

1493
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,160
Laura and Alfred had both been convicted

1494
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,860
of killing their parents,

1495
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:31,829
but there wasn't enough information

1496
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:34,360
to make a murder conviction stick.

1497
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,090
The State had offered them a plea deal.

1498
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:37,910
Plead guilty and they
would only have to go

1499
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:40,560
to a mental institution
until their 25th birthdays.

1500
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,393
- And after they were arrested,

1501
01:19:41,393 --> 01:19:42,780
they were both diagnosed with

1502
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,020
histrionic personality
disorder, schizophrenia,

1503
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,330
and a list of other mental disorders.

1504
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,510
- So she was never in foster care?

1505
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:51,479
- No, just state facilities.

1506
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:53,490
- [Megan] So where is this brother now?

1507
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:55,060
- [Daily] We're still
looking for him, Ma'am.

1508
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,450
But don't worry, he won't get far.

1509
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,750
- [Hanks] He has nowhere to go

1510
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:00,500
and no family on the outside.

1511
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,840
- [Daily] Please, trust us.

1512
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,440
You have nothing to worry about.

1513
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:23,702
(somber piano music)

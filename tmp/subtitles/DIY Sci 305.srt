1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:03,433
- Inside this garage lurks
the mind of a mad scientist.

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,167
(maniacal laughter)

3
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:06,166
He's one part inventor,
one part toy builder.

4
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,700
He's gonna show of some of
his amazing contraptions

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,967
that you can make at home.

6
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:10,867
(crash)

7
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:13,133
(shouting)

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,467
Forget parking a car,
because this garage

9
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:18,767
is made for do it yourself fun

10
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:21,000
right now on DIY Sci.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,233
(quirky music)

12
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,867
I'm Steve Spangler and
I love blowing stuff up

13
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,000
with the power of science.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm gonna show you how
you can do it yourself.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,233
(crashing)

16
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,400
You can harness the
power of science

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,027
in your own home with DIY Sci.

18
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:40,900
Yeah!

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,700
(liquid spraying)

20
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,333
(paper tearing)

21
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,027
Welcome to DIY Sci;
I'm Steve Spangler.

22
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:51,734
And you know this
guy, he's Bruce Yeany!

23
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:55,533
He won our DIY Sci contest
for best science video!

24
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,054
(tongue emulating drumroll)

25
00:00:57,054 --> 00:01:01,433
The winner of the DIY Sci
contest is Bruce Yeany!

26
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,100
(adventurous music)

27
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,900
Bruce is a retired
science teacher,

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,867
and he's also a
science inventor.

29
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,000
And this is his amazing
science workshop.

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,834
As it turns out, we're both
a bunch of garage geeks.

31
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,533
We love puttering
around in the garage

32
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,100
building stuff
for the workbench.

33
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,333
Today Bruce is gonna show us

34
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,800
some of the amazing
DIY Sci gadgets

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,567
that he's built in his garage,

36
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:30,633
like this amazing ping
pong ball launcher.

37
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,467
(crashing)

38
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,027
Looks like you went
to the hardware store.

39
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,467
You got some pipes, some
PVC that I recognize.

40
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:37,700
There's some other
pieces over here

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,934
that are kind of unusual.

42
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,834
- [Bruce] This here
is a vacuum pump.

43
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,800
- So by vacuum pump you
mean this doesn't pump air

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,667
into the pipe, it pulls
the air out of the pipe.

45
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,367
And it looks like
you've taken a balloon

46
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:53,054
like this mylar balloon, and
you've cut the balloon up

47
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,200
and you stretched it
over this end here

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,300
and clamped it in place.

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,333
So this is sealed.

50
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,600
- We have that end sealed.

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,433
- And this end is
sealed as well.

52
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,967
- [Bruce] We have a
ping pong ball in here.

53
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,600
And that's what's going
to be our projectile.

54
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
- Yes.

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,600
So you're gonna pull
all the air out of here

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,133
but the real action comes
when you poke it here.

57
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,400
- Air is gonna rush in.

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
That's 26 pounds of
pressure pushing in

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,533
that ping pong ball through
the tube with no resistance.

60
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,333
And we're gonna see what
happens to this can over here.

61
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,834
- [Steve] How fast will
it come out the end?

62
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,467
- We're looking at maybe
400, 500 miles and hour.

63
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,667
- No kidding.

64
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,000
- All right.
- So, safety glasses on.

65
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,266
(upbeat music)
(machine whirring)

66
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,800
We have a gauge here that's
gonna tell us when to stop.

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,133
And that looks about right.

68
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,133
- Okay, so stop.

69
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,433
You're telling me that all
the air is out of that pipe.

70
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:46,027
And so all you're going to
do for this destructive force

71
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:49,667
to happen is to simply
poke the little end there.

72
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:52,027
And that ping pong ball's
gonna go hurling this way.

73
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,567
- That's what's gonna happen.

74
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,400
- [Steve] All right, here we go!

75
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,667
- [Both] Ready?

76
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,000
- Three, two, one.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,834
(crashing)

78
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,567
Wow, look at this!

79
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,200
(crashing)

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,734
Oh my gosh, would
you look at this?

81
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,054
You weren't kidding.

82
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,767
That is a ping pong ball.

83
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:13,600
Not only, it just destroys it
at about 400 miles an hour.

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,767
(static and crashing)

85
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,433
- It's moving so fast it
just goes right through it.

86
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:26,133
(repeated crashing)

87
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,266
(gagging)

88
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,467
- Excuse me.

89
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:31,533
(crashing)

90
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,100
- Everybody watching
the show is saying

91
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
'Okay, but I can't
do that at home.

92
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,467
'I don't have a vacuum pump.'

93
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,734
I get that.

94
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,300
We can do something
else where we could

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,233
actually put air into the pipe

96
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,867
and shoot the ping pong
ball down this way.

97
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,500
Again, this is pretty
heavy duty PVC.

98
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,834
- Right, this is
rated at 200 PSI.

99
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,600
- And what you did was
you put a hole here.

100
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,500
You put a tire
valve, is that right?

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,767
- [Bruce] Right.
- [Steve] Here.

102
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,027
That's why you're
using this big pipe.

103
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,800
So you could get it in
there, glue it in place.

104
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,333
You've got a gauge
on this as well

105
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,800
so you really can see
how much is inside, and--

106
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,266
- [Bruce] That's our gate valve.

107
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,867
That's when it's sealed.

108
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,767
- [Steve] Everything here is
for plumbing, and you're using

109
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,233
none of it for plumbing, right?

110
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,166
- [Bruce] Well, who knows what

111
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,100
they're actually intended for.

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,367
- [Steve] That's exactly right.

113
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,834
- [Bruce] That's a
matter of opinion.

114
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,400
- [Steve] Yeah, safety glasses
on, let's pressurize this.

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,367
So we'll seal it up
here, and now you're just

116
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,800
gonna use a bicycle
pump to fill it up.

117
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,867
- [Bruce] Here we go.

118
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,834
(air pumping)

119
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:24,233
- [Steve] All right,
it's pressurized.

120
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,166
- [Bruce] Okay, ready?
- [Steve] We'll take that off.

121
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,333
- [Bruce] We'll take that off.

122
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,533
- [Steve] Good.

123
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,567
So the ping pong ball
goes into the end.

124
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,433
And let's load it up.

125
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,133
Got it, okay.

126
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,300
Keep it in place because it's
time to pile up the cans.

127
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,133
(upbeat drumbeat)

128
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:43,934
- [Bruce] Looks good.

129
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:45,166
All right, here we go.

130
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,700
- [Steve] I'm gonna aim
it here, ready: three.

131
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,027
- [Both] Two, one.

132
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:52,333
(cans clattering)

133
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,400
- I think that's perfect.

134
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,200
I can't even imagine
what it would be

135
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,133
if you had something larger.

136
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,667
(quirky music)

137
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,967
Now this is what happens when
you super size an air canon.

138
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,100
Bruce, you made this one
out of this amazingly

139
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,200
heavy duty PVC; this is
not the normal stuff.

140
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,467
- Nah, this is the
heavy duty stuff.

141
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:17,233
This is rated at 220 PSI.

142
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,400
And we're gonna be
putting in 90 PSI.

143
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,934
So we have a pretty
good safety margin.

144
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,567
- [Steve] Okay, but still the
joints have to be perfectly--

145
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,100
- [Bruce] They have
to be perfect, yes.

146
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,367
- [Steve] Mounted and glued
and everything else, and so.

147
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,900
Not a thing to try
at home, this is.

148
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,734
We're gonna leave this
one for us, fair enough?

149
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:31,900
All right so, I got a plan.

150
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,027
Look at this.

151
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,567
(intense drums)

152
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,200
Let's make apple sauce.

153
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,734
Okay, so.
- [Bruce] Let's do it!

154
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,200
- I'm just gonna put this
here; don't fire anything.

155
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,467
(adventurous music)

156
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:42,467
Think it should be
about right there.

157
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,054
- [Bruce] It's gonna be perfect.

158
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,233
- All right, ready?

159
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,800
These apples, I think
are the perfect size.

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,734
All right, load 'em up.

161
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,300
Excellent.
- [Bruce] That's good?

162
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,400
Right, bring it back up here.

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,834
We'll fill it with air.
- All right, here we go.

164
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,027
- 90 PSI.

165
00:05:57,027 --> 00:05:59,567
- 90 PSI; probably a
much better idea to just

166
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,734
buy apple sauce at the
store, but this is DIY Sci.

167
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,700
So this is the way we do it.

168
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,500
Line it up!
- [Bruce] You ready?

169
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,027
- I'm ready!

170
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,166
Three, two, one.

171
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,433
(crashes)

172
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:15,333
(laughing)

173
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
Well, that's the first one!

174
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,633
Now we only have
fifteen more to go!

175
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:22,633
(repeated crashing)

176
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:26,867
(laughing)

177
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:27,767
That's beautiful.

178
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,567
What we need is a
green apple as well.

179
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,200
'Cause you gotta
have good applesauce.

180
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,500
Really, it's a smart
way to make applesauce.

181
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,767
It's not.

182
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,900
So Bruce, we've got three
apples in the chamber.

183
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,934
Try to get some in that bowl.

184
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,100
Three, two, one!

185
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,700
(laughing)

186
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,600
I think there might be
a little bit of wood.

187
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
There's gonna be
some fiber in our.

188
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,054
You know what,
here's the problem.

189
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:56,600
We also need sweetness,
so all good applesauce

190
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,667
has a little bit of sugar.

191
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,266
It's more like powdered sugar.

192
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,567
- [Bruce] If it's
not powdered now,

193
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,200
it will be by the time
it hits that target.

194
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,133
- Okay, here we go.
- Ready?

195
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,600
- [Both] Three, two, one.

196
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,433
(crashing)

197
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,100
(laughing)

198
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,667
(upbeat music)

199
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,400
- That's perfect.

200
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,367
I think the sugar got
out, so that's good.

201
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,900
- [Bruce] It's still
kind of dry though.

202
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,433
- It is dry, it is dry.

203
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:24,800
So that's why I was thinking
this bottle of water,

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,633
this could be great.
- [Bruce] Okay.

205
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,567
(adventurous music)

206
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,767
Okay, that looks good.

207
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,200
Ready?
- Three, two, one!

208
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,734
(laughing)

209
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,054
(crashing)

210
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:44,054
I don't think there's
a GoPro anymore.

211
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,600
Sorry about that!

212
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,467
(crashing)

213
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,054
Well, you know what they say.

214
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,600
If you want to make applesauce,

215
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,233
you have to break some cameras.

216
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:59,200
This applesauce is great.

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,700
- [Bruce] It is; we
should write a cookbook.

218
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,500
- Probably not.

219
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,133
Coming up.
- Is this thing safe?

220
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,633
- [Steve] Who will win the race

221
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,400
of the homemade
skateboard racers?

222
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,054
The race isn't pretty.

223
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,500
It's the most amazing
string art you'll ever see.

224
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,667
That's not in slow motion!

225
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,934
And you can make it at home.

226
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,567
All still to come on DIY Sci.

227
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
(quirky music)

228
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,567
(disappointing riff)

229
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:37,600
Welcome back to DIY
Sci; I'm Steve Spangler.

230
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,054
I've just proved the obvious.

231
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:43,734
Drop a piece of string and
gravity pulls it to the table.

232
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,233
But that's not always the case,

233
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,834
especially if you're in
a mad scientist's garage,

234
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,800
like Bruce Yeany's garage.

235
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,133
Bruce, look at this.

236
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,000
(machine whirring)

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Wow, you drop the
string and you get art!

238
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,200
You get the coolest,
wait wait, look at this.

239
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,467
That's not in slow motion.

240
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,400
Look, we're not messing
around with this.

241
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Look at this: this
is a loop of string.

242
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,834
- This string is--
- It is moving.

243
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,400
- The string is actually moving
at about 25 miles an hour.

244
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,300
- How cool is that?

245
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,333
And you can angle it
different ways, is that right?

246
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,333
- We can angle it
different ways.

247
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,233
- Look at that.

248
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:22,800
Oh that's amazing, yes
yes yes look at this!

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,767
That is absolutely...

250
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,433
amazing.

251
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,834
All right Bruce, you gotta
show us how to DIY this.

252
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,133
- This is easier to make
than you might think.

253
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:39,027
- So you've got two craft
motors that you found online.

254
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:42,700
And this looks like these
are tires from a toy car.

255
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,054
- [Bruce] This
came off a toy car,

256
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,500
and the idea is to get
them close together.

257
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,100
- [Steve] Got it.
- So that it squeezes

258
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,166
the string just a little
bit, and as they're spinning

259
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,333
it's gonna push it out.

260
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,500
- Somehow you've connected a
piece of string into a loop.

261
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,734
And it doesn't look
like you have a knot.

262
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,266
- That's a little
bit of super glue.

263
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,800
- [Steve] Okay, so you
put some glue on there.

264
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,900
- Put some glue on it and
kind of rolled 'em smooth.

265
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,133
So you want it so that
when you pull like this

266
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,100
it doesn't get caught
between the wheels.

267
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,333
- [Bruce] Right.

268
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,266
- Second thing is you
did some fancy work

269
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,834
with a straw here; what is that?

270
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,734
- Well, I just took a straw
and heated it a little bit

271
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,767
and bent it so that
the straw is actually

272
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,700
gonna guide the string in
between the two wheels.

273
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,533
- Got it.

274
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,533
Look at that!

275
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,433
The two tires are squeezing
the rope in between

276
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,500
and shooting it out
but you're saying

277
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,000
gravity is pulling it back
around again, forming this loop.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,834
But you're actually
putting some energy in here

279
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,900
and that's why we're
seeing a wave, right?

280
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,533
- It's actually the same
thing as stretching out a rope

281
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:44,027
and just flicking it, and you
see the wave go down the rope.

282
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,467
We're doing the same thing.

283
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,333
- But because this
continues to curve around

284
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,834
it makes it the coolest
toy in the world.

285
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,500
Now, there's another version
that I played with here

286
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,700
when you weren't watching,
and I picked this up.

287
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,433
Would you show us
how this works?

288
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,967
- Yeah, see this is
just hanging down.

289
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:06,100
This is my hanging ribbon, and
there are switches down here.

290
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,767
(machine whirring)

291
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:13,100
And now once again we have a
moving ribbon in this case.

292
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,400
And if I pull it out once
again, we're gonna see these--

293
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,667
- Look at that.

294
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,967
- Slow moving waves
through the ribbon.

295
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,500
(bubbles)

296
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,533
- And this is what
happens when you supersize

297
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,200
the hanging rope
demonstration, right?

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
- Right.

299
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,834
- Look at this.

300
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,027
So, two by fours, huge.

301
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:36,400
It looks like there's a drill
up here hooked to a spindle

302
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,934
that allows this
plastic chain to move.

303
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:41,054
Plug it in, look at this.

304
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,567
(engine whirring)

305
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,633
You're putting energy into this
and it's becoming this wave.

306
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:49,834
But the wave looks like
it's moving in slow motion.

307
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,400
It's like the chain
is moving downwards

308
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,533
and the wave is trying
to force itself upwards.

309
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,700
So the wave gets slowed down.

310
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,467
Ah, look at this
on the bottom here.

311
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,100
It's absolutely gorgeous.

312
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:10,600
The amazing thing is that
we're not running this

313
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,967
in slow motion; this is
exactly how it looks.

314
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,467
Look at it correct
itself, watch this.

315
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,533
It'll spin itself around, and.

316
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,133
- There it is.

317
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,667
- It's gorgeous.

318
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,027
It's the perfect combination
of art and science

319
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:27,200
that makes this a great
geek garage project.

320
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,100
- That's amazing.

321
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,934
(chain rattling)

322
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,100
Whoa!

323
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,834
(bubbles)

324
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,533
Take a look at this; it's
a classic science toy.

325
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,667
It's called a ramp walker.

326
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,400
Bruce Yeany made this one.

327
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,700
What I love about this is that
it tumbles as it comes down

328
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,467
because not only are
we using gravity,

329
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,100
but we're also able
to change the weight

330
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
as it comes down the ramp.

331
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,333
Now, believe it
or not it's easier

332
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,800
to make than you might think.

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,367
We can start over here
by making the ramp.

334
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:03,027
This starts with a
yardstick or a meter stick

335
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:06,100
and we took some cardboard
and bent it around.

336
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,600
If you just had a ping pong
ball and you set it in the ramp

337
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,533
like this and made
it go back and forth,

338
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,100
well that's not a very fun toy.

339
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,166
So we gotta change
it up a little bit.

340
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,027
It's as easy as splitting
the ping pong ball in half

341
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:22,400
and putting the weight inside.

342
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,700
So take a look at this: there's
a piece of plastic here.

343
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,467
Some tape, and
then on the inside

344
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,000
it's that same ball bearing.

345
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
But what we're really
looking for it to do

346
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,100
is to transfer its
weight and flip over.

347
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,700
Oh that's perfect, look at that.

348
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:44,133
Nice, so you put a handle on
it like this and now watch.

349
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,233
Here's our little walker.

350
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,333
As the position of
the weight changes,

351
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,333
the little walker works
its way down the ramp.

352
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,700
Potential energy is turned
into kinetic energy.

353
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,054
The position of the weight
changes and that turns

354
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:02,054
into a fun science toy that's
easy for you to make at home.

355
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,433
Next on DIY Sci.

356
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,700
(shouting)

357
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,800
No, Higgensworth
hasn't lost his mind.

358
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,834
He's making weird sand
art, and you can too!

359
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,700
Find out how right
after this break.

360
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,333
(quirky music)

361
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,266
(yelling)

362
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,500
Welcome back to DIY Sci--

363
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,433
(yelling)

364
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,467
Welcome back to DIY Sci, I'm--

365
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,133
(yelling)

366
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,054
I'm Steve Spangler.

367
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:42,054
(yelling)

368
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,667
(It's always great to
have Higgens on the show.

369
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,400
Higgens, what are you doing?

370
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,266
- I'm screaming at
these sweet buckets.

371
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:50,600
- It's because it's one of Bruce
Yeany's coolest inventions.

372
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,967
It's the screaming sand bucket.

373
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,367
Do it again, would you?

374
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,533
(yelling)

375
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Look at the cool patterns
that are developing

376
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,266
on each one of these.

377
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,734
But this is so easy to
make to be able to show

378
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,266
the sound out of your
voice, that vibration.

379
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,100
And vibrating this
little drum here.

380
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Let's show 'em how to make it.

381
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
- All right.

382
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,300
- First of all, it's
easy, it's just a bucket

383
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,834
that he cut the bottom out of

384
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:17,266
and then stretched over the
top here, just a trash bag.

385
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,567
Really, really thin trash bag

386
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,333
and tried to get it as
tight as you can get it.

387
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,054
And the trick here
is really fine sand.

388
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,700
You could use very,
very fine salt

389
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,400
or here is this fine sand.

390
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,054
And the patterns that you get
I think are the most amazing.

391
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,467
As you're starting to see
these little resident frequency

392
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,900
patterns start to be
developed in here as well.

393
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,967
(yelling)

394
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,967
That's not his breath
that's doing that.

395
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:55,967
That's actually the
vibrations from his voice.

396
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,133
(yelling)

397
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,400
(quirky music)

398
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,700
Try to make it as
smooth as you can.

399
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,467
Try these little
whistles, would ya?

400
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:12,600
- All right.

401
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,934
(whistling)

402
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:19,967
- That's perfect, look at that!

403
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,734
Look at that frequency
that you set up there

404
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:23,367
and that little
pattern that's there.

405
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,400
You can see the
vibration was most

406
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,934
where the sand is missing.

407
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,767
We have nodes and antinodes

408
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,100
that you've seen
before in the waves

409
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,667
and that's actually
where it's sitting

410
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,100
there in that little antinode.

411
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,400
Try another one.

412
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,934
(whistling)

413
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,467
Different pattern.

414
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:41,133
All right, try this one.

415
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,467
(whistling)

416
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,934
Try this one, oh
there's a slide whistle.

417
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,300
- Whoa, cool.

418
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,934
(whistle changing pitch)

419
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,867
Stop that, don't use that
one ever again, all right?

420
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:57,934
Go back to this one, this is.

421
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,333
(whistling)

422
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:07,027
What an amazing way to be
able to see sound patterns

423
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:11,027
in something as simple as some
plastic stretched over a tub.

424
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:13,027
And a good friend who
will sit here and do this

425
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,533
for hours on end, keep--

426
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,700
(yelling)

427
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,166
(glass shattering)

428
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,027
Wanna zoom down the hill
on your own street luge?

429
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,333
It's not hard to make and we're
gonna show you how to do it.

430
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,767
Coming up next on DIY Sci.

431
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,333
(quirky music)

432
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,600
Welcome back to DIY
Sci, I'm Steve Spangler.

433
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
What good is a great
garage like this

434
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
unless you're coming
up with your own

435
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
means of transportation?

436
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,934
If you're Bruce Yeany
you know how to do this.

437
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,567
This looks like a skateboard

438
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,600
but you're calling
it a street luge.

439
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
- Yeah Steve, this was
actually first developed

440
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,300
in Southern California
where skateboarders

441
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,600
wanted to go a little
bit faster down hills

442
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,333
so they found,
instead of standing up

443
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,767
they made the board longer
and they could lay down on it.

444
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:10,734
- L U G E, luge, I think of
something in the Olympics

445
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,900
that they would have on
ice, but this is just

446
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,467
using a modified skateboard.
- Right.

447
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,433
We're simply taking
chucks off a skateboard.

448
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,567
We've mounted 'em on
this extended board.

449
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,600
And you've flipped
it over and you put

450
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,166
handles on either side.

451
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,054
- Handles to hold
onto, and then here

452
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,800
we have an extension for our
feet to be up off the ground.

453
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
You're not dragging
them on the ground

454
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,533
as you're going downhill.

455
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,767
- [Steve] So truly
you're laying down.

456
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,000
- You're laying
down on the board.

457
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
- And where is the
breaking action?

458
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,834
(tires screeching)

459
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,133
- The breaking action is
either using your feet

460
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,700
or aiming for a soft--
- So you're basically saying

461
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,533
you didn't design
a breaking action.

462
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,767
- There is no breaks on this.

463
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,300
- There's no breaks,
you're telling me

464
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,900
you're just inches from the
pavement, going down a hill,

465
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,054
and the only way to stop
is to put your feet out

466
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:53,500
and you just turn
with your body.

467
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,700
- That's pretty much it, yes.

468
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,300
- It seems really safe.

469
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,027
But good for Higgensworth
because we got two of them

470
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,633
and I think it's
time for a race.

471
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,900
(paper crumpling)

472
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,266
All right Higgens,
this is a race.

473
00:19:04,266 --> 00:19:07,567
- Okay, is thing safe?

474
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:08,867
- Uh.

475
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:10,100
- What are you looking
at me for, I don't know.

476
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,133
I didn't invent this.

477
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,133
- I don't know, we'll find out.

478
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:13,400
(laughing)

479
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,900
- It's safe, Higgens.
- How does this work?

480
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,967
- All right, have you ever
been on one of these before?

481
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:16,967
- Never.
- Never, okay, well.

482
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,467
Turn it around and the idea
is you're gonna sit on it.

483
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:27,027
Feet go here, and you're gonna
give yourself a good push.

484
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:29,027
Fast as you can, and
once you get going

485
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:31,800
then you're simply
going to lie down.

486
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,900
And if you tilt a little
bit it should steer.

487
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,700
You guys ready?

488
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,200
On your mark, get set.

489
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,633
- [Steve] Look
over there, Higgs!

490
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,867
(Steve laughing)

491
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,000
Higgs, look at me!

492
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,266
(shouting)

493
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,800
Steering is limited!

494
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,667
Steering the luge,
kind of difficult.

495
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,934
Because you're just moving
your body back and forth.

496
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:58,900
(shouting)

497
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
Okay man, we gotta turn!

498
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,633
Okay, we gotta land this thing!

499
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,800
You gotta think of it as a
skateboard but laying down,

500
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,667
which is a weird sensation.

501
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,934
(shouting)

502
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,367
Look at where my
feet are, Higgens.

503
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,967
I won.

504
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:37,333
- And the winner
is Steve Spangler!

505
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,266
- See you later, Higgs!

506
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,667
(soft music)

507
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,867
This'd be a really
effective way to get to work

508
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,233
if your work was
always downhill.

509
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,400
And you only had
that far to come

510
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,800
and there was nobody
in front of you

511
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,967
and you didn't have to
worry about stopping.

512
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,934
And you could have somebody's
lawn that you could stop in.

513
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,967
Okay, let's go.

514
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,800
(groaning)

515
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm getting too old for this.

516
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,300
Glad we picked a place
that wasn't muddy to stop.

517
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:14,300
Don't go away, there'll be
more DIY Sci after this!

518
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,767
(quirky music)

519
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,934
So what did we learn today?

520
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:28,800
We learned how to harness air
pressure to propel an apple

521
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,166
hard enough to make
our own applesauce.

522
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,533
We discovered how
to make sand art

523
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:38,300
just with the
vibrations of our voice.

524
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,800
- Is this thing safe?

525
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,200
- We saw that it just
takes a little ingenuity

526
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
(shouting)

527
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,734
to come up with a new means
of ground transportation.

528
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,700
And we learned how much fun
it is to be a garage geek.

529
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,967
Huge thanks to Bruce Yeany

530
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,300
for opening up his
amazing garage.

531
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,533
I'm Steve Spangler.

532
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,834
We'll see you next
time on DIY Sci.

533
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,333

1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,119
- Welcome to the F Word,

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:04,212
it's going to be hot
in the kitchen tonight.

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:06,642
Mica Paris and the family battle it out

4
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:08,393
to become my best performing Brigade.

5
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:09,940
- Okay guys, you are falling asleep,

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,959
you've got to wake up again.

7
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,930
- [Gordon] By cooking a three
course dinner of Mackerel

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,838
and warm potato salad.

9
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:17,454
A mouth watering pigeon casserole

10
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:19,845
and a gorgeous strawberry glory.

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,825
Plus Janet get's arsey
with the British Public.

12
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,767
- Oh, yes, just like your size in'it?

13
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:28,817
- What do you mean, just like my size?

14
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:30,822
Right, get rid of him.

15
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,948
- And I go back to the floor

16
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,627
to learn how to make one of the greatest

17
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:35,952
of all Chinese delicacies, Dim Sum.

18
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,037
I have never been in a kitchen where

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,100
I have never been in control,

20
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,450
so this is really fucking weird.

(applause)

36
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,482
- Right, the Mica Paris
family, how are we?

37
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,006
Hello my darling, good
to see you, are you well?

38
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:20,139
Cherry, how are you sweetheart?

39
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:21,863
- I'm fine, thank you
- Who's the oldest?

40
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:23,176
- Oh.
- She is

41
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:24,480
- Oh, bless, how are you sweet?

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,418
- I'm the baby.

43
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,753
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

44
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,674
- Trevor, how are you?

45
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:30,350
You and I are out numbered big boy, yes?

46
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,530
Three diva's against two talented cooks.

47
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,398
- Yes, yes.

48
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:34,532
- Basically, we're fucked.
- Yes.

49
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,103
- Meet tonight's Brigade,
the Mica Paris family.

50
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,417
Soul diva Mica is joined by big sister,

51
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,701
Paula, a hairdresser.

52
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,366
These two love to cook almost
as much as they love to fight.

53
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,874
Dad, Trevor, a retired chauffeur

54
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,636
worked as a chef in his 20s.

55
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:56,505
Can he still cope

56
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:59,055
with the fast pace of
a professional kitchen?

57
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:01,861
And mom Cherry, a retired Secretary

58
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,759
claims she's never messed up a meal,

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,063
let's hope it stays that way.

60
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:08,826
There's no room for divas
this family must pull together

61
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:11,120
if they are gonna get
out 50 perfect dishes.

62
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,584
Okay, I am going to show you
how to do the starter, yes?

63
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,535
Pan fried fillet of mackerel
on a warm potato salad.

64
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,278
Mackerel, a little seasoning,
salt and pepper, okay, good,

65
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,384
right, a nice hot pan.

66
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:29,097
Okay, mackerel in, okay
get that nice and crispy,

67
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:32,245
it will curl up naturally,
put your fingers on.

68
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,592
And then after about 30 seconds,

69
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:35,895
it starts to release the fibres

70
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,595
and then just settles back down.

71
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:41,171
Always cook mackerel skin
side first 90% of the cooking

72
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,402
will take place on its skin, yeah?

73
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,968
We cook it and turn it over
we get dry very, very quickly.

74
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:48,084
Mackerel's officially pink,
and you have a tartar,

75
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,576
you can eat it raw, you can marinade it,

76
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:51,664
so be very, very careful
when it over cooks,

77
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:53,757
it gets very, very dry.

78
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,072
Okay potatoes in, the
potatoes have been part boiled

79
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:57,941
all we want to do is give it a little bit

80
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:59,346
of colour in the pan.

81
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,628
Sour cream.

82
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:03,840
A little tea spoon of mustard, yeah?

83
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,469
Mix the mustard in.

84
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,994
- Did you put salt and
pepper on the potato?

85
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:11,606
- Yeah, a little bit of seasoning.

86
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:14,173
Potatoes, in.

87
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:18,059
Okay, Spring onions, mix
it up with the sour cream,

88
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:21,712
and the mustard, what you
want is a really light mustard

89
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:25,966
warm potato salad, a touch
of Chardonnay vinegar, yeah,

90
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,165
it just wakes everything up a little bit,

91
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,219
gives it a nice sharp contrast

92
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,148
to the richness of the sour cream okay?

93
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,526
Mackerel out, nicely coloured,

94
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,027
literally finish it on top.

95
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:37,022
Sour dough, nice and crispy on.

96
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:42,983
Potatoes, you have the
crisp mackerel, now okay.

97
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,237
And look, just to make
sure they don't slide

98
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:51,158
all over the place, take a
little spoon, put it on there,

99
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,754
and that just stops it from sliding, yeah?

100
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:57,550
Then, lambs lettuce again,
just gently on the seasoning,

101
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,769
little touch of salt and
pepper, and a little glaze.

102
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:02,742
- [Cherry] The heat's taking its toll now.

103
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,265
- [Gordon Ramsay] Of olive
oil, it's dressed good,

104
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,871
a little bit of green, okay.

105
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,960
Very, very simple, have a little taste.

106
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,294
- Oh, that is so lovely.

107
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,150
- Okay, concentrate I want
four covers on table nine,

108
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,900
four mackerel, four pigeon
and four strawberry glory.

109
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,769
- Yes, Chef.

110
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,982
- We will go in two
two's as a four, Trevor.

111
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:26,265
Trevor, we are doing that
as two two's as the four.

112
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,680
- Yes chef.

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,633
- You have got to put two more in there.

114
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,897
- Fuck me, its going to be a
long night, yeah holy Fuck.

115
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,287
- [All] Yes chef

116
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:38,743
- Harry, put your crisps
away, put your crisps away.

117
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,426
- I've put them away,

118
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,803
I've got to eat something decent tonight.

119
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,770
- You are going to get fed.

120
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,594
- Thank you very much.

121
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,761
Do you want a crisp?

122
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,079
- [Gordon Ramsay] Guys.

123
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,595
- You are taking really long, right?

124
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,532
- Who me?

125
00:04:56,532 --> 00:04:58,527
- You are taking really long
with the potatoes, girlfriend.

126
00:04:58,527 --> 00:04:59,799
- Come on, that's good, nice.

127
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,575
Right, let's do a bit each,

128
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,449
a little bit of salad around the outside.

129
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,502
- What you need to do, is get this ready.

130
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:06,657
- Salt and pepper.

131
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:07,828
- You want the salt and pepper?

132
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:08,697
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:12,618
- Touch of salt, Trevor,
touch of salt, Trevor.

134
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,700
You are here to cook, yeah, not to watch.

135
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,853
Now, are you happy with those?

136
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:16,721
- Lovely,

137
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:17,590
- [Gordon Ramsay] Would you pay for them?

138
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,695
- I would pay for them, very nice.

139
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:20,612
- Good, so would I, lets go,
under the hot plate, lets go.

140
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,009
Table six, please Jose.

141
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,677
Now we are doing four more, yes?

142
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,152
- Here's a food skill I've
always wanted to learn.

143
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:33,531
(Chinese music)

144
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,761
I love Chinese food,

145
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,243
but there's one amazing
delicacy so specialised

146
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:39,985
that few western chefs
have ever mastered it.

147
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:43,179
So today, I'm off in search of
some eastern culinary wisdom.

148
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,756
This, is Chinese Dim
Sum an absolute staple,

149
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:51,205
eat it for breakfast lunch,

150
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,904
every day and for the first time,

151
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:54,542
I am going to learn how
to cook them properly

152
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,724
but under immense fucking pressure.

153
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,287
Dim Sum means touch the heart.

154
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,687
And it's easy to see why.

155
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:05,010
Here at London's Royal China Club,

156
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,023
they serve a vast array
of beautiful intricate

157
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,966
little dumplings and rolls
from regions all over China.

158
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:16,449
What began as a simple Chinese snack

159
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,056
has evolved over thousands
of years into big business

160
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:20,195
all over the world.

161
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,474
Helping me to demystify the
ancient world of Dim Sum

162
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,436
is Chinese Cookery Expert, Fuschia Dunlop.

163
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,219
- This is one of the
Dim Sum that sometimes

164
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,814
Westerners find a bit more tricky

165
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,931
because it has that slithery texture

166
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:42,332
which Chinese gourmet's
really adore to eat.

167
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:44,282
- [Gordon Ramsay] I'm used to being

168
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,290
the boss of the kitchen,

169
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,348
but as a Dim Sum virgin, today
I am happy to be a pupil.

170
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:50,942
- Here we have the main kitchen area.

171
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,799
- Now these guys are very
small, do you mean petit,

172
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,468
look at the space, it's
minute behind here.

173
00:06:56,468 --> 00:07:00,238
- Yeah and it's like an inferno
when all the woks are going.

174
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:01,393
- Shit and this one here.

175
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,454
- It's for steaming the Dim Sum

176
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:04,969
so you could have a stack of them.

177
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,250
- [Gordon Ramsay] Okay on top.

178
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,178
Later, my challenge will be

179
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,439
to get through a busy service

180
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,421
at this top London Dim Sum restaurant.

181
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:15,393
But with just a couple
of hours before lunch,

182
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,166
I've got a hell of a lot to learn.

183
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:24,861
For now, I've been put under
the expert guidance of Jung.

184
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,603
If anyone can speed teach
me this incredible art,

185
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,545
he's my man.

186
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:31,732
In his 20 years as a Dim Sum chef,

187
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,589
he'll have made well over two million

188
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,343
of these tricky little parcels.

189
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:38,750
But there is one small problem,

190
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,512
So he doesn't speak any English at all?

191
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,381
- No.

192
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:42,889
- I am screwed then, nothing at all.

193
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,057
Hello, good morning.

194
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,567
No, I am fucked.

195
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:51,548
Luckily, Fuscia's on hand to
translate his instructions.

196
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,417
Good to see you.

197
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,285
- Good Morning.

198
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,808
- So, what is this rice flour?

199
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,356
My first lesson is how to make
a prawn filled potato flour

200
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,871
dumpling called Har Gow.

201
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,187
Fold it in?

202
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:12,179
Just like pasta, the
secret to good Dim Sum

203
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,275
is as much about the
wrapper as the filling.

204
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:17,351
That's what's going to hold all
the flavour and moisture in.

205
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,628
Hard.

206
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,735
- [Jung] (speaks Chinese)

207
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:27,830
- [Fuschia] He said he's going to show you

208
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,311
how to press the skins,

209
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:30,833
now on the dough.

210
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,817
- Press the skins.

211
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:34,410
Unlike an Italian kitchen,

212
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,339
there are no pasta machines in sight.

213
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:44,482
Jesus, he's using the palm
of his hand, my God, fuck.

214
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:00,178
They are beautiful, they are so soft.

215
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:04,700
Jung made it look easy, now it's my turn.

216
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,800
- Use the finger of this hand to push it,

217
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,104
just your index finger.

218
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,092
So you are holding this

219
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,317
and just pinching but you
push it with that finger.

220
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,369
- [Jung] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,706
- [Fuschia] He is saying Dim
Sum are particularly difficult

222
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:31,039
because of all this fine finger work

223
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,737
and you have to be a bit calm and patient.

224
00:09:33,737 --> 00:09:36,796
- Calm and patient, well I
am screwed straight away.

225
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:38,453
Calm and patient.

226
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,477
I can't remember being
this nervous in the kitchen

227
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,343
and as any pastry chef will tell you,

228
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:44,959
hot sweaty hands are not what you need

229
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,337
with all this delicate work.

230
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:52,355
It's so intricate, so
difficult, Jesus Christ,

231
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:55,765
they are extraordinary,
that is a lot fucking harder

232
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,382
than it looks, I tell you, such intricacy.

233
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,988
And if I thought that was difficult,

234
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,616
I hadn't bargained on Jung's next lesson.

235
00:10:05,616 --> 00:10:08,973
Cheug Fun, paper thin cheese
and rice and potato flour

236
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,215
batter wrapped around
a choice of fillings.

237
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:16,150
Fucking hell.

238
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,330
- It's really hot so
the most important thing

239
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,829
of this is not to be afraid
of scolding your hands

240
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,697
in the steam.

241
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,566
- [Gordon Ramsay] Right.

242
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,168
- After just three minutes
this skin-scorching

243
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,827
paper thin sheets of batter
are ready to be rolled.

244
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:34,040
It's sticking to the top
like shit to a blanket.

245
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,260
I hadn't felt this clumsy since

246
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,801
I first set foot in a
kitchen 20 years ago.

247
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:42,580
The real killer is to wrap the filling

248
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,366
tightly without splitting it.

249
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,530
Fuck me, that was hard,
I mean seriously hard,

250
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,399
it's very intricate,

251
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,286
its all in the manipulation of the dough.

252
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,046
With training over, next I will be

253
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,548
put to the test under
hard as nails, Henry Chau.

254
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,405
As the Kitchen's Head Chef,

255
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:08,491
I am told he's every bit as tough as me.

256
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:13,162
Fuck knows what service
is going to be like.

257
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,594
Mica, this is all overcooked.

258
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:23,577
- Oh, it is?

259
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:24,445
- [Gordon Ramsay] Touch it.

260
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:25,314
- I know

261
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:26,307
- [Gordon Ramsay] Absolute rubber.

262
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,678
- Oh, alright, sorry, what can I say?

263
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:29,773
Where is the love?

264
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,597
- I am trying to fucking get there.

265
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:33,982
- [Mica] You see that is the problem

266
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,851
you know what the problem was,

267
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:35,872
that was trying to help P.

268
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:37,526
- Oh, stop trying to blame me for it,

269
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:39,263
do you know what?

270
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,878
Take your own responsibilities, love.

271
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:43,234
- If I wasn't watching her,

272
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,542
I would have done the mackerel good.

273
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,678
- Whatever!

274
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,061
- [Gordon Ramsay] God, Cherry and Trevor,

275
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:50,022
I wish your daughters were
working as quick as you two, yes?

276
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:50,891
Look at them.

277
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,827
Right you two can you do something, yes?

278
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:53,718
- [Paula] yeah.

279
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:55,058
- Give me room, man, give me room.

280
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,268
- [Gordon Ramsay] So,
you get the salad now

281
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:57,136
and dress the salad.

282
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,357
- [Mica] Pea did you do that yourself?

283
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,226
Yea.

284
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:00,095
- Very good.

285
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:00,963
- [Gordon Ramsay] Come on, come on, guys.

286
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:02,826
Diva, are you happy with those?

287
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,675
- [Cherry] Let me see,
yeah, I'm all right with it,

288
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,528
I'm not too crazy about those two,

289
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:09,114
I'll be straight 'cause it's
curled up, is that alright?

290
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:10,125
- I'm glad you've
answered at least to Diva,

291
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:10,994
at least you know.

292
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:12,326
- See, you've got me again.

293
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:14,265
- Service.

294
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,548
Fucking hell.

295
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:17,021
Last table, well done.

296
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,589
- I really enjoyed it,

297
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:24,119
the mackerel itself was quite simple

298
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,110
but you get the kick from the mustard

299
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,258
and the spring onion afterwards.

300
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:29,551
Really livened the dish up.

301
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:30,729
- Visually it looked really great,

302
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,366
there was lovely green sort of colouring

303
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:33,680
and the yellow was you know,

304
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,467
the taste was great, so
yeah, it worked really well.

305
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,555
- OK, Jose, results please.

306
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:45,651
OK, the number of diners
that are willing to pay

307
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:49,073
for their starter is, oh shit.

308
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:50,018
45 out of 50.

309
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,148
- [All] Cheer

310
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,191
- There it is, amazing.

311
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,581
That is amazing.

312
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,048
Unbelievable.

313
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,200
Now, that is fucking good news, well done.

314
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,069
- Thank you Chef.

315
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,255
- Main course, let's get 50 out of 50.

316
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:07,123
- Yes.

317
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:07,992
- [Gordon Ramsay] Let's clear down,

318
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,703
get on your stations, let's go.

319
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:12,323
- Coming up, the Brigade
attempt to cook pigeon breast

320
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,772
with a summer vegetable casserole.

321
00:13:13,772 --> 00:13:16,556
Out the way, fucking hell.

322
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:17,978
But things fall apart.

323
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:23,845
Now we just go down like
a fucking dog's dinner.

324
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,973
(title music plays)

325
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,301
- [Gordon Ramsay] Right, Cherry, get up,

326
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:33,170
- Yes.

327
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,095
- [Gordon Ramsay] let's go, good girl.

328
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:34,963
- We're on chef.

329
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:37,549
- Welcome back to the F word,
time for the main course.

330
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:41,331
Pigeon breast, with a
summer vegetable casserole.

331
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:44,681
One of my favourite birds,
very lean and very healthy.

332
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:50,778
Salt, pepper, hot pan, olive oil,

333
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:55,669
Pigeon breast, skin side down first.

334
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,840
(sizzle)

335
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,249
Turn.

336
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:03,106
The most exciting thing
about cooking pigeons

337
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:05,991
is they cook in minutes.

338
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:06,860
Rest.

339
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:09,954
Garnish for the casserole,

340
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:13,019
a nice alternative to potatoes
are puff pastry fleuron.

341
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,510
Puff pastry.

342
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,618
Cut your holes, and then
cut them in half again,

343
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:21,382
so you have got this really
nice sort of half moon shape.

344
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:25,921
Egg wash, salt, thyme,

345
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:29,682
200 degrees in.

346
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:30,870
We are serving the pigeon casserole

347
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,593
with a combination of delicious
and summery vegetables.

348
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:35,660
Smoked pancetta.

349
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:38,795
Give the pancetta a really nice colour.

350
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:43,088
Garlic, girolles.

351
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,316
That looks quite sort of autumnal,
this is the summery part.

352
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:54,529
Asparagus, baby carrots,
baby leeks, blanch, beetroot,

353
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:02,534
Look at the colours of that, beautiful.

354
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,019
Red wine vinegar.

355
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,887
You're going to glaze that down to a syrup

356
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,261
which will start to coat the vegetables .

357
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,823
Chicken stock, tarragon, broad beans.

358
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,588
Beautiful for the summer,

359
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,516
the smoked pancetta has given body

360
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,923
to the vegetable casserole,

361
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,439
but the flavours in
there are extraordinary.

362
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:29,325
Slice the pigeon in half,

363
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:32,154
and you will see the colour
of the pigeon, nice and pink.

364
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:40,836
Small drizzle of olive oil,
puff pastry case on top.

365
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:46,251
Pigeon with a summer
vegetable casserole, done.

366
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,832
Come on, Mica we get 50 out of 50 now.

367
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:52,398
- [Mica] I know, I know, I know.

368
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,266
- [Gordon Ramsay] Paula,

369
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,135
- Yes.

370
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:55,003
- I love this, hand on hip,

371
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:58,169
shake, shake, shake, Jesus Christ.

372
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:02,003
So, they come out yeah,
we rest them skin side up,

373
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:06,319
red wine vinegar in, let
that reduce down, now, Paula.

374
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,188
- Yes?

375
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,958
- Get your pigeons in,
let's go, two portions each.

376
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,808
Right Mica, the idea is to
colour them, not cremate them.

377
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,027
(laughter)

378
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:15,978
Trevor.

379
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:16,846
- Yes, Chef?

380
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:19,104
- [Gordon Ramsay] We are there,
beautiful, nice and pink.

381
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,974
Very, very nice, Trevor
are we happy with that?

382
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:25,843
- [Trevor] Yes, Chef.

383
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:28,352
- [Gordon Ramsay] Good man,
make them all like that.

384
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,223
- [Paula] You've done five.

385
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,509
- Fucking hell, Mica.

386
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:35,328
- [Mica] All right, calm down.

387
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,569
- [Paula] Why have you done five?

388
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:37,438
- Alright man

389
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:39,338
- I need the juice

390
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:43,151
- chill man, chill
- For fuck's sake.

391
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:44,648
Jesus Christ.

392
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:47,573
Right, look at me, look, Paula come here.

393
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,516
I've got one and a half pigeon,

394
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:50,142
I've only got three bits of pigeon there,

395
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,011
I've got two bits of pigeon there,

396
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,622
four bits of pigeon there,

397
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:55,359
and one, two, three, four,
and five bits of there,

398
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,174
come on guys, we are seriously
letting ourselves down.

399
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:01,750
Now, no, no, no, come here.

400
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,619
- [Mica] Nice.

401
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,878
- Holy shit.

402
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:05,692
What do you want me to
do, fucking floss with it?

403
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,353
Jesus Christ Almighty.

404
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:15,087
Watch out, Janet Street
Porter's getting fruity.

405
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:21,635
- [Janet] Smoothies,
heavenly fruit filled drinks.

406
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:26,848
Mango and passion fruit,
raspberry, coconut and banana.

407
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:31,926
The perfect way to get your five a day.

408
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,649
What, You've got to be joking,
who writes this rubbish?

409
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:39,184
My goodness, we love smoothies, don't we?

410
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,197
In fact, we drink so
much of the ruddy stuff

411
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:46,368
it could fill 14 Olympic
swimming pools in a year.

412
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:49,715
That's almost 60 million pints.

413
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:52,072
Personally, I can't stand smoothies,

414
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,210
but you lot seem to think that
they are a healthy antidote

415
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,141
to 21st Century excess, but are they?

416
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,956
If anyone bothered to read
the labels they might be

417
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:06,033
surprised to find out what
they are really drinking.

418
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:11,143
A typical 250ml portion is
packed with natural sugar.

419
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:14,886
A portion of this smoothie
has twice the sugar

420
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,257
and twice the calories
as this can of Tango.

421
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:27,565
This smoothie has got just as much sugar

422
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,217
in it as this chocolate bar.

423
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:38,305
Now this smoothie has
got twice as much sugar

424
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:42,153
and twice as much calories
as this can of Lilt.

425
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:52,559
It's not all bad news,
smoothies do contain vitamin C

426
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,957
and many contain fibre too.

427
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:58,492
Essential for a healthy digestive system,

428
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,987
but what about the natural sugars?

429
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:03,956
I want to hear the facts from

430
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:07,324
Kath Collins, an expert dietician.

431
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:10,900
I've never, ever, ever, drunk smoothie,

432
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,944
to me they are like green slurry,

433
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,238
but they are hugely popular.

434
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,824
- Well they are because they
count towards your five a day,

435
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,962
and everyone knows they should
be eating more fruit and veg

436
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,672
and they are a good
source of fibre actually,

437
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:23,194
they do contribute fibre.

438
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,060
The problem is they're full of sugar.

439
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,146
- I thought it was natural sugar.

440
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,721
- Sugar is sugar, it has
the same calorie load,

441
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:31,369
the same affect on your teeth,

442
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,237
if you're having an apple,

443
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,871
you've got about ten
grammes of sugar in there,

444
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,811
if you are having a smoothie,

445
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:38,473
you can be having three
times in one little drink

446
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:41,056
and you can swallow that
in less that a minute

447
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:41,924
and that's the problem,

448
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,902
it's just so much sugar
in a very small volume

449
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:45,633
taken in a very short period of time.

450
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,864
- What happens when you
drink too many smoothies?

451
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:49,293
- If you are in energy balance,

452
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,232
the amount of calories you are
eating from your daily diet

453
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,203
is the same as the amount your body needs,

454
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,612
if you have an extra smoothie each day,

455
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,697
its giving you at least 125 calories

456
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,875
and over a year that would

457
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,618
be an extra stone in weight, 13/14 lbs.

458
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,673
They are not a low calorie
drink and it is actually better

459
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:07,408
to eat the fruit than
it is to buy a smoothie.

460
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,522
- [Janet] It's official,

461
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,685
drinking to excess isn't good for you.

462
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,041
Oh, that looks disgusting.

463
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:19,500
This is certainly not going to convert me.

464
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,639
I've had enough of this trendy obsession

465
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,787
with drinking fresh fruit.

466
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:26,653
I'm on a mission to tell people

467
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:29,305
it's far better for you just to eat it.

468
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,701
now to really make my point,

469
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:36,684
I've got here this repulsive fake ass.

470
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:41,251
Now this weighs 13lbs
and that is the amount

471
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:44,046
of weight you could put on in a year

472
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:48,707
if you drank one extra
smoothie every single day,

473
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:53,016
than your body actually needed,
so let's try lifting it.

474
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:56,144
Help, come here!

475
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:03,284
Drink one smoothie a day
in addition to your normal

476
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:05,922
calorie intake and you
could put on weight.

477
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,851
But do people know this?

478
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,405
If they are not exercising
enough to burn off

479
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:11,657
their excess sugar,

480
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:15,077
they could be lumbered
with a fat ass like mine.

481
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:19,247
One portion of that has
got more sugar that that.

482
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,116
- No!

483
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,133
- [Janet] Did you know that?

484
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:22,195
- No, not at all.

485
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:23,870
- You always think that a smoothie

486
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,837
would be much better for
you than a fizzy drink.

487
00:21:25,837 --> 00:21:26,849
- Wow.

488
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,139
- Let's see your ass.

489
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,007
- [Man On Street] It's heavy.

490
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:29,903
- [Janet] 13 lbs.

491
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,575
- [Man On Street] (laughs)

492
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,512
- [Janet] You won't be
doing any running in that.

493
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:34,773
(laughs)

494
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:35,642
What does it feel like?

495
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:36,859
- A bit heavy.

496
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:37,902
- Gross.

497
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:40,748
- I drink these because they
are meant to be good for you.

498
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,698
- The fruit is better

499
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:44,888
- I don't want that bottom.

500
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,848
- [Janet] Just hold this bottom, just try.

501
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,662
- This is from smoothies?

502
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,372
Yeah that's quite shocking, actually.

503
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,862
- When you eat an apple,

504
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,368
it takes twice as long to eat

505
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,420
than slurping down that smoothie.

506
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,953
Do you know how much
weight you can put on?

507
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,878
- I just drink once, one a day.

508
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:01,863
- (mumbles)

509
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,771
- Oh, yea, just like your size in'it?

510
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,220
- What do you mean just like my size?

511
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,005
- (laughs)

512
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:10,258
- Right, get rid of him.

513
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:13,434
I was going to give you a
smoothie, you can bugger off now.

514
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:17,020
Well I think I've made my point
with that horrible big ass,

515
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,943
and I hope, very much,

516
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:22,060
that the commuters of London
will now drink less smoothies

517
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,183
and try eating a few more of these.

518
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:26,523
There's only one old smoothie

519
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:29,297
that I've got left to convince.

520
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:31,851
- Janet, good to see you my darling.

521
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,720
- Hello.

522
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,653
- You are looking
absolutely ravishing, right,

523
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,669
what have you been banging
on about this week?

524
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,359
- I've been taking smoothies out

525
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,279
and trying to convert people
to drink less smoothies

526
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,699
and eat more real fruit.

527
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,101
- I love smoothies,
what's wrong with them?

528
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:48,424
- How many do you eat a week?

529
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:49,722
- One a day, seven days a week.

530
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:50,591
- One a day.

531
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,460
You don't.

532
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,328
- Yeah, no, serious.

533
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:53,210
- It's a good job you're hyperactive.

534
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,947
- Are they seriously that full of sugar?

535
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:57,940
- They are strong of
natural sugar fructose,

536
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,609
which is still sugar.

537
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,008
- So you are saying eat fresh
fruit instead of a smoothie?

538
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:03,876
- Yeah.

539
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:04,745
- I can see you are
wearing that rubber ass,

540
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:05,613
it suits you, it makes that dress.

541
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:06,720
- I have got the rubber ass here.

542
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,911
- Oh, you haven't got it on.

543
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:10,484
I thought you had it on.

544
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:13,729
- This is the rubber ass, that you--

545
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:17,522
now that is what Gordon's
ass is going to look like

546
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:21,088
if he carries on having a smoothie a day.

547
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,957
- For a year.

548
00:23:21,957 --> 00:23:23,570
- And if you stop running marathons,

549
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,438
God help you,

550
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,124
because that's what your
bum's going to look like.

551
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:27,240
- That looks like a pair of boobs.

552
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,045
- Not that high up, over the bum.

553
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:29,944
- No, I know, it's a Simon Cowell,

554
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:33,327
it's going to sag, like everything at 60.

555
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:34,196
- Woo.

556
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,544
- Jesus Christ.

557
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,901
You look nice with a nice
firm buttock like that Janet.

558
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,380
Janet don't forget your ass.

559
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,249
Janet!

560
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:51,060
Cherry,
- yeah.

561
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,015
- Now the pigeon's burnt.

562
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,079
Fuck me, watch out, yeah, they are burnt,

563
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,789
they are fucking burnt, yeah,

564
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:57,427
when they are browned,
yep they are cooked,

565
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:59,244
when they are black they are fucked, yeah?

566
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,921
Fucking Hell.

567
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:04,569
Now we are just going down
like a fucking dog's dinner.

568
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,438
Mica.

569
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:06,457
- [Mica] Yes.

570
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:07,326
- Don't go sulking and don't give up.

571
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:08,230
- [Mica] No I don't give up.

572
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,354
- [Gordon Ramsay] Good, lets go then

573
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:13,695
- [Paula] Just focus, focus, focus.

574
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,026
- Thank you.

575
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:15,895
- Okay Put the pan down there.

576
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:17,415
Put the pan down you are on fire,

577
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:22,138
no, no on the stove, out
the way, fucking hell,

578
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:23,413
- [Mica] Why did you do that

579
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:26,280
- [Paula] Because it was burning.

580
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:29,417
- [Mica] Jesus.

581
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,797
OK then, nice one, P.

582
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,668
- Right, Cherry, table of four, yes?

583
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:36,536
- [Cherry] Table of four.

584
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:37,405
- Good girl.

585
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:38,275
Trevor, you've got a table of four, yes?

586
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,143
- [Trevor] Yes.

587
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,012
- [Mica] Four coming up.

588
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,836
- Put it on, cut the puff
pastry please Cherry.

589
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,386
Trevor, I am loving you, well done.

590
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:46,194
- [Trevor] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

591
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,226
- [Gordon Ramsay] One talented Dad.

592
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:48,732
Mica, Paris, let's go.

593
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:49,847
- Oh, I don't like the
way you are doing that.

594
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,930
- Right, now look at me,
look, it's such a shame,

595
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,566
I have got all the fat
still in the lardons, look.

596
00:24:56,566 --> 00:25:00,086
- I didn't leave them in long enough.

597
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,697
Don't worry, I'll do it again.

598
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:03,566
- Mica

599
00:25:03,566 --> 00:25:05,839
- [Mica] Yea, coming man, chill.

600
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,913
- Coming man, chill.

601
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:09,822
- [Mica] Really, just chill.

602
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,556
- That's the story of tonight.

603
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:21,709
Right, how are we?

604
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:22,577
- Very well thank you.

605
00:25:22,577 --> 00:25:23,721
- Good, nice to see
you, how was the pigeon.

606
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:24,725
The sauce that it went with,

607
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:27,484
I think we all sort of thought
it was very, very salty

608
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,144
and we couldn't really eat it.

609
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:30,822
- What a shame, it was
burnt chicken stock,

610
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,917
so it was there to act
as a bit of a broth.

611
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,296
- It almost felt as though
it felt it was misnamed,

612
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:39,675
if it had been pigeon and
summer vegetables with a "jus".

613
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,229
- A "Jus"?

614
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:43,098
Look at you.

615
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,400
You've done a Master Chef haven't you?

616
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,413
- The tarragon was fantastic,
it really came through,

617
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,634
really fresh liquorish flavour,

618
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,325
the pigeon was cooked really
well, crispy on the outside,

619
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:55,461
tender in the middle.

620
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:56,330
- I thought it was very flavoursome

621
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,279
and it was quite a strong taste and yea,

622
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,373
it was really lovely.

623
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:05,211
- Right, Jose, the amount of customers

624
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:07,922
that are gonna pay for the
main course out of 50....

625
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,004
35 out of 50

626
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:14,872
- [Mica] What did I say?

627
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:18,255
- [Cherry] Oh, it was me,
that's what I said, hey!

628
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:19,123
- [Mica] Well done, Mum.

629
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:21,164
- Let's get 50 out of 50 the desert,

630
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,631
back to sections, let's get going.

631
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:26,238
(theme music)

632
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:32,425
- Hello, and welcome back to the F Word

633
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,073
and now it's time for the recipe challenge

634
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:37,868
with internationally
acclaimed super model, Me.

635
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,297
Come on then.

636
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,412
- OK, what are you doing?

637
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:41,650
- I'm doing a veg curry.

638
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,918
- Oh, come on, Jo, for God's sake.

639
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:44,787
- You love a vegetarian.

640
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:46,422
- Yeah I do when they're fast asleep.

641
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,858
Why are you doing a veg curry.

642
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,756
- Well, because if it
doesn't taste nice enough,

643
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:53,363
I'll just chop up a
vegetarian and put them in.

644
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:54,925
- Now that I like the sound of.

645
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,481
Right, when was the last
time you practised the dish.

646
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,639
- [Jo] Oh, about 1947.

647
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:01,307
- Is it a dish made with rationing?

648
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:02,820
- It was, yeah.

649
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,208
- Right, vegetable curry
and Jo's doing a classic.

650
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,077
What's the ingredients?

651
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:07,210
Just quickly run through,
tell me what they are.

652
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,328
- That's an onion, have
you seen one before?

653
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,820
- Yes, that's something rather, scary.

654
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,883
You've been in Delia's cupboard,

655
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:14,898
What is that, a jar of what?

656
00:27:14,898 --> 00:27:17,710
- That, it's a Balti curry paste.

657
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,463
- You lazy bugger.

658
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:22,191
- Well, what's wrong with being lazy?

659
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:23,546
I am just going to chop up some garlic

660
00:27:23,546 --> 00:27:26,469
and a bit of ginger and
put that in as well.

661
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:30,202
- Jo, to my horror
brought in a curry paste,

662
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,370
so easy to make.

663
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,967
Coriander seeds, poppy seeds,
turmeric, garlic, ginger

664
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,407
and chilli powder into a pestle and mortar

665
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,826
and from there a tablespoon
of ground nut oil and then,

666
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,599
just a table spoon of white wine vinegar.

667
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,028
That forms a really nice paste

668
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,249
and it is ten times tastier than

669
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,200
- How do you know it's really nice?

670
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,730
- I know it tastes delicious
because I have made it before.

671
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,289
You do a lot of cooking
at home, don't you?

672
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:53,968
- Yea, just cooking that is simple.

673
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,738
That doesn't take very long,

674
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:57,761
so I can go and practise my other hobby

675
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,307
which is being an alcoholic.

676
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,580
- Now you've got two
beautiful little girls, yea?

677
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,448
- [Jo] Yes.

678
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:06,317
- Yep Maisie and

679
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,186
- Eliza.

680
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,054
- Eliza.

681
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:08,923
- [Gordon Ramsay]
Lovely, how old are they?

682
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,294
- One's 43 and the other's 2.

683
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:15,956
- Seriously, now how old are they?

684
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:16,824
- Five and seven.

685
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:17,693
- Five and seven.

686
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:18,562
What do you cook at home?

687
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:22,066
- I do a very nice Haribo
stew which they like

688
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:27,280
and then I give them chocolate,
that's the main course.

689
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,646
- Lucky, lucky kids you know that?

690
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:29,763
They must love you.

691
00:28:29,763 --> 00:28:30,999
On tour, yes?

692
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:31,868
- [Jo] On tour

693
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:32,736
- [Gordon Ramsay] What
kind of food do you eat?

694
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:35,552
- I like a nice pork pie when I'm on tour,

695
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,885
yea, anything you can get in a garage

696
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:41,143
made by Ginsters always does me a treat.

697
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:42,034
- Do you know what,

698
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,082
you just make me feel more
confident about winning,

699
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:46,048
you know that?

700
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:48,082
- I've browned my onions

701
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:51,450
and then I've put some pepper
and some aubergines in,

702
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,662
I am just going to dice up some
potato and some cauliflower

703
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:57,101
and bung that in.

704
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,802
- [Gordon Ramsay] Most
daunting gig ever was when?

705
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:04,268
- Well I think it was probably
a gig that I did up in Bolton

706
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,653
in a working Men's club.

707
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:08,717
- [Gordon Ramsay] Yep.

708
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:12,323
- And as one they all shouted
'fuck off you fat lezzer'

709
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,452
as I went on.

710
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:16,478
- And it's true in the early days,

711
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:17,891
the Lesbians used to complain about you

712
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,384
giving them a bad reputation, right?

713
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,782
- Over the years they've signed petitions

714
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:24,295
and sent them to me
telling me to tell everyone

715
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,974
that I'm heterosexual 'cause it's giving

716
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,843
lesbians a bad reputation.

717
00:29:29,123 --> 00:29:33,533
- OK, sweat the aubergines
and the shallots down first,

718
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,264
garlic, chili's take the heat out of them.

719
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:38,072
In with the broccoli, and
a cauliflower, peppers.

720
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:45,817
- I am now grating some lard,
that's my secret ingredient.

721
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:46,685
- Lard?

722
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,714
- Alright, it's coconut.

723
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:48,583
- [Gordon Ramsay] It's coconut,

724
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,661
quite a jazzy curry this you know that?

725
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:51,530
- Is it?

726
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,403
- [Gordon Ramsay] Well it sounds it.

727
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:54,700
- You're from Scotland aren't you?

728
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,561
They are very healthy there aren't they?

729
00:29:57,561 --> 00:30:00,070
'cause I always used to think
that Scotland, you know,

730
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,397
they've got the highest rate
of heart disease in Europe

731
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,433
which means you get decent grub there.

732
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:08,360
- You've lost a lot of
weight, haven't you?

733
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,195
- I've lost a bit of weight.

734
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:11,884
- Are you training or is it through diet?

735
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:13,833
- You know I trained for
the marathon years ago.

736
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,847
- I heard you trained for
the marathon, what happened?

737
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:19,142
- Thank Christ, I had
a virus the week before

738
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:20,010
so I couldn't do it.

739
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,519
- And all that training.

740
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,968
- Or should I say, I shouldn't say Christ

741
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:26,014
on tele because people
get upset, thank fuck.

742
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:27,859
(laughs)

743
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,090
- Were you looking forward
to running the marathon?

744
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,113
- Well what I wasn't looking forward to,

745
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,522
was dying in front of thousands of people

746
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,233
'cause I thought I might
because I am a fat person.

747
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,333
- I was a fat chef once.

748
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,276
- Were you?

749
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:40,205
- Seventeen and a half stone,

750
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,707
in fact just under 18 stone
when I ran my first marathon.

751
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:43,575
- Wow.

752
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,668
- It was a fucking nightmare,
I got back, it was dark,

753
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:46,537
the family had fucked off home

754
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:48,713
and I was picking cones
up on the way home.

755
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,978
- You see that's the
thing I was worried about,

756
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:53,165
because I estimated my
time doing the marathon.

757
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,034
- go on.

758
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,741
- About 12 and a half hours.

759
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:57,315
- You could do it within
12 hours Jo, come on.

760
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,184
- You reckon?

761
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,238
- Curry paste in, a handful of coriander,

762
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,699
rolled up and just fry up the coriander,

763
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:08,910
finish with a touch of garlic
and some chopped tomatoes.

764
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,210
Up to the boil and let it cook out.

765
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,990
- What does 'cook out' mean?

766
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,022
- Cook out is when the
raw paste, curry paste,

767
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:19,984
is very tart because its very raw,

768
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:24,627
so raw garlic, raw ginger, and
cook it out, let it mellow.

769
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,875
- Can I come and have a look at yours?

770
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,157
- You can come and have a look at mine.

771
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,159
Now its sort of disintegrated and--

772
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,028
- That looks like something you could

773
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:31,915
get out of a Heinz tin.

774
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:35,597
- Jo Brand.

775
00:31:35,597 --> 00:31:37,178
Right, we are going to leave
both curry's to simmer now,

776
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:39,654
come back and Jo loses, simple as that.

777
00:31:39,654 --> 00:31:42,782
- (Blows raspberry)

778
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,615
- Right, back to the Dim Sum
and its time for service.

779
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,952
In my quest to learn how to make Dim Sum

780
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:52,485
I am about to be thrown in at the deep end

781
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:54,258
of the Royal China Club in London.

782
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:59,137
This place can do over 200 covers

783
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,962
and like any Head Chef worth his salt,

784
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,589
the uncompromising Henry Chau,

785
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,351
expects his brigade to jump on the orders

786
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,602
as soon as they come on.

787
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,114
Trouble is, they are all in Chinese.

788
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:11,679
How the fuck do you understand
that, what does that say?

789
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,289
- That says the fresh shrimp Cheung fun.

790
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,158
- [Gordon Ramsay] Fresh shrimp cheung fun

791
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,669
- [Fuschia] So you already
know how to make it.

792
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,430
- I have never been in a
kitchen where I have never

793
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,985
been in control, so this
is really fucking weird.

794
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:38,687
But icy cold Head Chef
Henry is in control,

795
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,669
he's clearly a man after my own heart.

796
00:32:43,223 --> 00:32:44,964
He won't let a morsel leave his kitchen

797
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,980
unless its absolutely perfect.

798
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:50,950
Understandably, he's watching
his most recent recruit

799
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,818
like a hawk.

800
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,538
So will my first effort pass muster

801
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,000
with my tough new master?

802
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,318
- No.

803
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:03,517
- No, what's wrong.

804
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:08,155
- [Fuschia] He says its not alright,

805
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:11,544
- [Gordon Ramsay] What's wrong with it?

806
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:13,462
- [Fuschia] it's not tight enough,

807
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,496
it's too lose its not
wrapped tightly enough

808
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,184
round the dough stack.

809
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:20,010
You have to do it tightly next time.

810
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,879
- Tighter.

811
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,916
Fucking hell, he's a fucking rotweiler.

812
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:26,384
More shrimp.

813
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,171
Coming now.

814
00:33:31,104 --> 00:33:31,973
Jesus.

815
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,350
I am determined to get some
of my Dim Sum past Henry

816
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,730
and out to the diners.

817
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,870
I may be an award winning chef,

818
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,048
but as soon as I am sending plates out,

819
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:49,981
they are coming back.

820
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:54,534
Can someone go for the soup
and give the dumpling a rest.

821
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:57,828
I think Fuschia's enjoying
this a lot more than I am.

822
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:58,903
- [Fuschia] They are too
small and there is not

823
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,409
enough filling in them,
they should be fuller.

824
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,962
- [Gordon Ramsay] It's a
pleasure to learn a new skill,

825
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,927
but I hate getting a
bollocking, even in translation.

826
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,922
With service nearly over,

827
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,904
it's my last chance to
achieve Dim Sum perfection.

828
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,833
Fucking hell, he's worse than me,

829
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,241
that fucker, you know that?

830
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:26,423
Jesus Christ.

831
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,940
He's happy with that last one, yes?

832
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,300
- Very good.

833
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,596
- Excellent, happy?

834
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,917
Yea, good, fuck me, thank
fuck for that, I tell you.

835
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:38,821
Jesus Christ.

836
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:42,165
That was fucking phenomenal,

837
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,958
really tough to begin
with and very intricate

838
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,732
but who would have thought
that your spending £3, £4.50

839
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:50,601
for a bowl of fucking Dim Sum
and they are all made by hand,

840
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,540
extraordinary, just goes to prove

841
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,282
that fucking Chinese cookery
is not all about a wok.

842
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,568
Fucking hats off.

843
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:02,008
Working in Henry's kitchen
has really inspired me

844
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,363
and with lunch service out of the way,

845
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,310
I want to show him a dish of my own.

846
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:10,492
Right, I am going to do a
little dumpling that I make

847
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:11,952
and see what the guys think.

848
00:35:13,915 --> 00:35:16,866
My Chinese style tortellini is
based on a mixture of prawn,

849
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,653
scallops and crispy duck.

850
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:21,082
The texture of the scallop

851
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:22,361
and the shrimp together, delicious.

852
00:35:23,342 --> 00:35:25,385
I'm hoping Head Chef Henry
will be so impressed,

853
00:35:25,385 --> 00:35:26,793
he will put it on his menu.

854
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,173
Oh, that fell off, just chop that off.

855
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,867
Really nice combination the duck.

856
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,566
I am adding finely chopped ginger,

857
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:42,256
garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice.

858
00:35:42,256 --> 00:35:45,242
Lemon juice in, okay, coriander.

859
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:48,961
Finely, some finely sliced mixed veg.

860
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,529
Texture, good colour, in,

861
00:35:54,216 --> 00:35:56,646
keep it nice and whole
so you can identify it.

862
00:35:56,646 --> 00:36:01,182
Right, so, these.

863
00:36:01,182 --> 00:36:04,174
I am borrowing a few of Jung's
expertly flattened skins.

864
00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:09,033
The scallops, really nip it
together, little tortellinis.

865
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:15,592
Nice, very good.

866
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:16,460
We steam now.

867
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,004
Yea, 4 minutes.

868
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,892
Nice, they look good.

869
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:23,975
So what does the Dim Sum
Master and his Brigade

870
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,168
make of my Duck and Sea Food Tortellini?

871
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:29,877
Do you like, Henry?

872
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,549
- Little.

873
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:33,696
- What don't you like?

874
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,519
- [Translator] Five out of ten

875
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,349
- Five out of ten, little fucker.

876
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,589
Five out of ten!

877
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,935
Hey, tell him there's
no MSG in there either.

878
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:48,253
Jesus.

879
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:50,731
Five out of ten from these
guys is high praise indeed,

880
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:54,016
in another 20 years,
maybe I'll merit a six

881
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,153
So it's not going on the special tonight?

882
00:36:58,551 --> 00:36:59,420
- No.

883
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:03,661
- Tell him when go goes back
to school, I'll take over.

884
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:10,531
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

885
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:15,731
Ah, fuck.

886
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,380
- [Mica] It's all going pear shaped.

887
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,543
- You're like a fucking
bull in a china shop.

888
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:27,657
For fuck sake, now whip
the cream up, let's go.

889
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:31,241
- Gordon! It just came off by itself.

890
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,110
- Fucking hell.

891
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,828
Guys, that's the eject
button, that's the on button.

892
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:36,697
- That's why it came off.

893
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,063
- Mica will blame the apparatus.

894
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:41,699
(music plays)

895
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:42,567
Strawberry Glory.

896
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:46,068
A great way of celebrating the
best of British Strawberries.

897
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:48,508
Strawberries, half.

898
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:52,240
Icing sugar, balsamic vinegar.

899
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,181
The combination of the
tartness of the vinegar

900
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:58,403
against the sweetness of the
strawberries is mind blowing.

901
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,415
Drizzle over the strawberries.

902
00:38:00,415 --> 00:38:03,126
Icing sugar, pan,

903
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:04,805
Nice and hot.

904
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:05,681
Strawberries in.

905
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:06,619
Caramelise.

906
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:10,960
This needs 15 to 20 seconds, a
quick toss and then back out.

907
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:14,711
Crème patisserie

908
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,172
Commonly known as a
really nice thick custard.

909
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,196
Milk, cream, boil.

910
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:22,473
Egg yolks, sugar.

911
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:24,825
Whip, whip, whip.

912
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:25,694
Flour.

913
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,955
Take out one third of the cream and milk,

914
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,228
stir, this has liquefied,

915
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:35,012
all of your milk and your cream in there.

916
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,578
Put it back in the pan, bring
the custard up to the boil,

917
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:41,081
which will cause it to
go really nice and thick.

918
00:38:44,564 --> 00:38:46,204
Into the fridge to cool down.

919
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:49,454
Cream, icing sugar.

920
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:50,684
Don't over whip the cream,

921
00:38:50,684 --> 00:38:53,326
just as its starting to
fall through your whisk.

922
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:57,976
Get your thick custard,
take off one third.

923
00:38:58,932 --> 00:38:59,801
Whisk.

924
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,317
and the rest of it straight in.

925
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:05,147
Look at that.

926
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:07,931
Nice, just falling through the whisk.

927
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,286
Now for the exciting part,

928
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:11,278
putting this little baby together.

929
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:16,491
Strawberries, juice, pastry
cream, crushed meringue, repeat.

930
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:22,758
Really nice ball of vanilla ice cream.

931
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:25,918
Sit that on top of the thick rich custard.

932
00:39:25,918 --> 00:39:28,799
Juice, grated chocolate.

933
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:33,352
It wouldn't be complete
without one of these,

934
00:39:33,352 --> 00:39:35,461
the good old fashioned British wafer.

935
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,572
Strawberry Glory, done.

936
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:46,647
Strawberries, meringue,
cream, strawberries, meringue,

937
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:48,377
cream, ice cream, chocolate, wafer.

938
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:50,115
- [Mica] Yea, OK.

939
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:52,757
- [Gordon Ramsay] Sprinkle the
chocolate on top, well done.

940
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,127
Good, off you go buddy.

941
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:55,207
Off you go.

942
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:57,053
If no one pays for this desert, yea,

943
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:59,733
they don't deserve to be in
here, go please, go please,

944
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:00,851
come on, go go go go let's go.

945
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,718
Mica, my Darling, are you with me?

946
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:11,317
- Yea, I'm along with you
man, alright, so there you go,

947
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:13,371
that's another four, yea?

948
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:17,678
- Earth to Trevor, Earth to
Trevor, wafers, wafers, fuck me,

949
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,440
wafers, I'm gonna need a fucking week

950
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,999
at the Priory after this fucking service.

951
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,015
Lets go.

952
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:23,145
Holy Fuck.

953
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,479
What was the naughtiest thing you two did

954
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:29,585
when you were kids?

955
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:30,816
- I know what she did to me.

956
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:31,684
What was naughty.

957
00:40:31,684 --> 00:40:32,867
- Go on.

958
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,580
- One day, I think I was about nine,

959
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,219
and she stole my 2 pence,
do you remember that.

960
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:38,938
- I didn't steal it.

961
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,784
- She took my 2 pence
but you don't understand.

962
00:40:40,784 --> 00:40:44,037
Back then 2 pence was like ten pounds

963
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:45,080
when you were a kid back then.

964
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,949
You know, it was a lot of money

965
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:46,817
- Serious

966
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:48,406
- I didn't steel it, I was teasing her.

967
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:49,459
- Can I tell him the story?

968
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:50,870
- She was indoors,

969
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,067
- yea, she ran off with my 2 p.

970
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,246
- And she ran off when
I was playing a game

971
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,593
- Can I just tell him the story!

972
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:58,857
- Oh, for God's sake.

973
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,352
- I was banging to door down,

974
00:41:00,352 --> 00:41:02,417
I was like, "I want my 2 p."

975
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,214
I was screaming.

976
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,659
- Tonight, you are going
to forgive her, right now.

977
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:09,045
- Yea, I am sorry.

978
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,005
- Now, right, kiss and make up, yes.

979
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:15,746
Will you forgive her?

980
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:18,582
- Alright then, give it back, right now.

981
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:20,268
- I gave it back to you silly woman.

982
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,739
- Only two left, let's go,
make these perfect, right,

983
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:32,040
let's go, let's go, let's go.

984
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,329
Last table.

985
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,666
- Can I just say that I feel
like a weight has been lifted.

986
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:40,931
- Last table, Cherry,
Trevor, well, fucking done.

987
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:44,848
- [All] (Cheer)

988
00:41:44,848 --> 00:41:46,923
- Coming up, will Jo Brand be laughing

989
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:48,791
at the results of the recipe challenge.

990
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,824
Is it going to be Jo Brand or Jo Bland?

991
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,201
Harry Enfield sorts out desert.

992
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:56,380
- Now Mitch, do you
remember you are taking Coke

993
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,342
and you are on smack now, aren't you?

994
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,552
- and we find out whether the
Brigade has what it takes to

995
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,211
come back to the F Word
Restaurant for final service.

996
00:42:04,211 --> 00:42:09,425
The number of guests that are
going to pay for desert, is,

997
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,260
(Title music)

998
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,197
Right, welcome back to the F Word,

999
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,883
and time for the results
of the recipe challenge

1000
00:42:19,883 --> 00:42:21,197
and for Jo Brand to understand

1001
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:23,950
why you should never use
a bought in curry paste.

1002
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,170
Are you ready?

1003
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,454
Now, this is the bit, I seriously like.

1004
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:31,009
Side by side, you see mine looks delicious

1005
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:34,349
and yours looks like it's out
of a jar, that's very chefie.

1006
00:42:36,236 --> 00:42:39,465
Jose, come back with the
right result and good luck.

1007
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:40,925
- [Jo] Yea, good luck loser.

1008
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:44,299
- [All] Thank you.

1009
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:48,046
- Just got a big bit
of black pepper there.

1010
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:50,566
- [Female Diner] Really, Mmm.

1011
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:53,466
It's very mild though isn't it?

1012
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:54,369
- [Male Diner] Its not hot at all.

1013
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:56,625
- Its not got a massive
amount of flavour to it.

1014
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,460
- [Male Diner] Next one.

1015
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:04,921
There's a lot more going on there

1016
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:06,065
- It tastes more like how you think

1017
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:07,810
a curry should taste, doesn't it?

1018
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,897
- Yea, a lot more flavour.

1019
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:12,556
- And its got a good after
taste, a lot more punch.

1020
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:15,637
- OK, here we go, how
are you feeling first?

1021
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:16,753
- Oh, very confident.

1022
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:17,804
- Very confident, yes,

1023
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,536
is it going to be Jo Brand or Jo Bland?

1024
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:21,862
- It was actually quite close.

1025
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:24,489
- Right come on, they liked
both, who's the winner?

1026
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:25,954
- Gordon, you did.

1027
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:26,823
- Oh, bollocks.

1028
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:28,045
- What was the, give us the,

1029
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:29,578
- For Jo, the fresh flavours.

1030
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,580
Certainly a bit more overpowering

1031
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,105
on the coriander, I believe.

1032
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:35,107
- Coriander.

1033
00:43:35,107 --> 00:43:38,775
I did put half a tree
in, look at your face,

1034
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,886
you're loving this, aren't you?

1035
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:40,755
- I am.

1036
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,907
- Do you want to do a
little dance on the pass?

1037
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,335
- Yes!

1038
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,941
Excellent, you know I hate losing.

1039
00:43:48,941 --> 00:43:50,093
- Ha Ha!

1040
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,642
- I've been waiting all
day for that one, yes?

1041
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,776
Really good to see you,
thanks but no thanks.

1042
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,208
Now fuck off out of my kitchen.

1043
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,076
- Yea, up yours.

1044
00:43:57,153 --> 00:43:59,325
(laughs)

1045
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:03,536
- How was desert?

1046
00:44:03,536 --> 00:44:04,404
- Absolutely delicious.

1047
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:05,447
- I licked my bowl.

1048
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:06,746
- You licked your bowl?

1049
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:09,953
That's my kind of girl,
well done, excellent,

1050
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:10,821
and did you manage to get your tongue

1051
00:44:10,821 --> 00:44:11,690
all the way down to the bottom?

1052
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,576
- No, I had to put my finger in.

1053
00:44:14,576 --> 00:44:15,457
- Happy diners, I am so pleased

1054
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:16,418
and are you going to pay for desert?

1055
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:18,099
- Definitely, we'll pay for everything.

1056
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:22,099
- Ladies, really good to see you, yes?

1057
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,820
- It's extremely fresh, it,

1058
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,665
everything complimented each other,

1059
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:27,573
the juices were gorgeous,

1060
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:30,722
and the strawberries just
melted in your mouth.

1061
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:32,610
- Gentlemen, good to see you.

1062
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,547
Harry, how are you?

1063
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,416
- Hello.

1064
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:35,284
- Welcome.

1065
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:36,153
- Oh, thank you very much.

1066
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:37,021
- Good to see you guys.

1067
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,115
How was dinner?

1068
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:38,984
- It was fantastic.

1069
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:40,628
- What did you like about it?

1070
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:41,497
- The salt,

1071
00:44:41,497 --> 00:44:42,365
- [Gordon Ramsay] The salt.

1072
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:44,069
- Basically.

1073
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:45,039
It was delicious.

1074
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:46,738
- 'cause you're quite a foodie, right?

1075
00:44:46,738 --> 00:44:48,605
- Can't you tell I am a foodie?

1076
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,759
I actually seduced my wife through food.

1077
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,360
- Serious, what did you cook?

1078
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,831
- Well it was something
from a Delia Smith book, but

1079
00:44:55,831 --> 00:44:56,924
- Get away.

1080
00:44:56,924 --> 00:44:57,792
- No, it was

1081
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:58,661
- What, from cans?

1082
00:44:58,661 --> 00:44:59,529
- It was 15 years ago

1083
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:00,398
- Oh 15 years ago

1084
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,730
- Yea, and I remember it was Cod

1085
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,154
and it had capers and it
was actually delicious.

1086
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:07,022
- What was it?

1087
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:09,177
- It was a coddy-capery thing.

1088
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:11,374
Anyway, I won her with that meal

1089
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:14,099
and I never had to cook
again, she's a very good cook.

1090
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:17,321
- You used to date Lily
Allen's Mum at one stage.

1091
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:18,687
You didn't know she was
going to be a potential star

1092
00:45:18,687 --> 00:45:21,273
did you, could you see it at that age?

1093
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:25,757
- She was always very
clever and very, very funny

1094
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:28,030
and slightly ahead of the crowd.

1095
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,192
She was in my show, she was like a kid

1096
00:45:31,192 --> 00:45:32,253
and you know we did the old gigs,

1097
00:45:32,253 --> 00:45:35,016
and we'd scare a kid and she's be there

1098
00:45:35,016 --> 00:45:36,955
and Amy Winehouse was in the Fast Shows,

1099
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:38,582
so, we were quite cool you know.

1100
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:41,335
- Recently you've been
involved in dramas, yes?

1101
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:42,415
- Yes.

1102
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:43,283
- Did you run out of jokes?

1103
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,491
Did you go dry, did you--

1104
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:48,650
- Oh, no, I just got asked
to do this Skins thing.

1105
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,783
I had done a bit of directing
and I had got asked to do--

1106
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:51,651
- [Gordon Ramsay] I love it.

1107
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:52,520
- some of that, so I did that.

1108
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,671
They were all very good
all the people in it,

1109
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,141
they were all very good,
but they're kinda young

1110
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:59,217
so it's a bit like being a school teacher,

1111
00:45:59,217 --> 00:46:01,094
because they don't really
concentrate, do they?

1112
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,859
You know they are busy
with their own lives

1113
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,014
and doing what they do.

1114
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:05,114
So you have to sort of go,

1115
00:46:05,114 --> 00:46:08,577
"OK, fine, come on everyone,
what at we doing, OK,

1116
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:10,308
"now Mitch, do you remember you are taking

1117
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:11,987
"coke in this scene.

1118
00:46:11,987 --> 00:46:13,551
"Have you got your coke, have you?

1119
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:14,969
"Have you got your line

1120
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:17,222
"and you're on smack
now, aren't you Jerry?

1121
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,570
"Where is your smack?

1122
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,438
"You haven't got it have
you, could we get the smack."

1123
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:23,835
There's quite a lot of that
that goes on, OK, and turn over.

1124
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:35,934
- That is so good

1125
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:37,370
- Right.

1126
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,582
Jose, please give me the results quickly,

1127
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:40,865
I am shitting myself, yes?

1128
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:41,801
(laughs)

1129
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,595
Whatever happens, I thought
you did bloody well,

1130
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:45,753
you were fast you were
good and more importantly,

1131
00:46:45,753 --> 00:46:48,214
you worked as a team again, yes?

1132
00:46:48,214 --> 00:46:49,476
And one thing that came out of it,

1133
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,811
you are a lovely tight knit family.

1134
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,553
Well done, really well done.

1135
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:57,531
The number of guests that are
going to pay for deserts is,

1136
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:02,551
- [Cherry] 50, 50.

1137
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:04,077
44 out of 50.

1138
00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:06,530
- [All] (Cheer)

1139
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,399
- That's good.

1140
00:47:07,399 --> 00:47:08,876
- Thank you guys.

1141
00:47:10,296 --> 00:47:13,354
- Well done, well done, well done.

1142
00:47:13,354 --> 00:47:18,567
So a grand total of 124
out of 150, well done.

1143
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,161
Well done.

1144
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:24,990
Now, Mica, here is the good news,

1145
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:27,462
sadly you are not coming back.

1146
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:32,152
(mumbles)

1147
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:37,743
- On the menu next week,

1148
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:40,172
I am bottling my own beer
for the F Word restaurant.

1149
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:41,736
- This looks overfilled to me.

1150
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:45,031
- [Gordon Ramsay] If there's any left.

1151
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,081
Woo hoo!

1152
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:51,006
I teach comedian Rob Brydon how
to shuck the perfect oyster.

1153
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:52,533
You've left half the scale
on the top of the shell

1154
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,707
- I know.

1155
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:54,575
I am not a chef,

1156
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:56,880
go and do some comedy you cheeky bugger.

1157
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:01,089
- And it's the end of the
line for David and Elton

1158
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,914
when Janet takes them to slaughter.

1159
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:07,356
(Cow moo's)

1160
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:08,224
- Thanks for watching,

1161
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:09,316
try the recipes at home and believe me,

1162
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:12,656
they are absolutely fucking
delicious, goodnight.

1163
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:20,056
- I am walking away from here smiling

1164
00:48:20,056 --> 00:48:22,079
knowing that everybody
out there was happy.

1165
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,653
- Once is enough.

1166
00:48:23,653 --> 00:48:27,143
(laughs) Can't take no more.

1167
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:28,481
- I want to say experience of my life

1168
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,650
which I never thought I could do.

1169
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,749
- I am absolutely exhausted,
knackered, so, yea,

1170
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:39,177
I'm thinking some bubbly
now, don't you think?

1171
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:41,870
(guitar music)

1172
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:08,917
- [Gordon Ramsay] I've got
a new series of kitchen

1173
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,346
nightmares coming soon.

1174
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:13,130
So if you need my help turning
your restaurant around.

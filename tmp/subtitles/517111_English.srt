176
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,533
Thank you so much for this meal.

177
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,168
You're welcome, sweetie.

178
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,169
But isn't that crazy dog

179
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,303
over in the next yard?

180
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:15,671
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,707
Noelle, don't you

182
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,208
ever jump that fence.

183
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,343
I can outrun that dog.

184
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:21,310
No, you can't.

185
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,712
The dog has four legs.

186
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,180
You only have two.

187
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,181
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,749
Oh, hey, Mr. Wright.

189
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:27,583
Hey, what's up, Noelle?

190
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,784
Hey, your father's outside in

191
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:29,485
the front for you.

192
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,454
Oh, okay.

193
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:33,055
Well, thank you, Ms. Wright.

194
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:35,391
You're very welcome.

195
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,593
See you later, girl.

196
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:38,627
She's a good kid.

197
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,062
I mean, she seems trustworthy.

198
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,230
I don't know why her father just

199
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,164
doesn't give her keys to the

200
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:42,765
house.

201
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,066
He's a man.

202
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:48,270
Sometimes men do stupid things.

203
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,372
What's that supposed to mean?

204
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,040
Nothing, nothing, just a

205
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,574
joke.

206
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:53,075
Maybe you'd have got it if I

207
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:54,777
sent it via text or e-mail.

208
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:56,145
maybe.

209
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,780
[ Laughs ]

210
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,081
I know what you tryin' to do.

211
00:06:59,081 --> 00:06:59,582
Mm-hmm.

212
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:00,316
Tryin' to bait me

213
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:01,550
into an argument.

214
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,284
Hmm, but I'm not

215
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,119
gonna go for it.

216
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:04,553
What's up your butt?

217
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,422
We are disconnected, Omar,

218
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:07,790
like, seriously.

219
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,758
I mean, I've said it before.

220
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,459
But you don't get it.

221
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:12,395
Our communication sucks.

222
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:13,229
Okay.

223
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:15,131
So, we're disconnected. Okay.

224
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:17,533
So, you want to communicate?

225
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:19,201
Okay. If you want to

226
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,736
communicate, let's communicate.

227
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:22,371
I can't remember the last time

228
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,139
you asked me how

229
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,474
Wrights Investments was doin'.

230
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,610
Okay.

231
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,413
How's your business goin'?

232
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,747
Oh, it's great, honey.

233
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:32,782
It'd be even better if my wife

234
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:33,749
was a little bit more supportive

235
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,719
of me.

236
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:37,620
You need me to be more

237
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,721
supportive of you?

238
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,789
Did I really

239
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,257
just hear you say that right?

240
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,591
Yeah. You heard me.

241
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,325
I mean, come on.

242
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,260
When's the last time you came up

243
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,428
to the office and helped around?

244
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,229
Excuse me, when was the last

245
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,764
time I was even invited to your

246
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:49,498
office?

247
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,200
Carmen, come on. I mean,

248
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,668
you really got to be invited up?

249
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,136
You can just come.

250
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,137
That just goes to prove

251
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,539
that you've been slackin'.

252
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,674
Slacking?

253
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:01,410
Wow. Really?

254
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,578
Who helped start your business

255
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:04,113
from the ground up?

256
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:04,547
'Cause it sure

257

as the...wasn't a slacker.

258
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,683
Did a slacker pay the mortgage

259
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:08,717
and all the other bills for a

260
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,152
year-and-a-half when you started

261
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,420
your business?

262
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,154
Did a slacker do

263
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,422
your business proposal

264
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:14,490
or prepare your paperwork for

265
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,458
three years before you could

266
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,792
even afford to hire someone?

267
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,393
I'm sorry.

268
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:19,161
Is that not supportive?

269
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,229
I didn't say you weren't

270
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:20,729
supportive.

271
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:21,831
Okay, you want to know what my

272
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:22,798
problem is?

273
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,433
It's the rollin' of your eyes,

the suckin' of the teeth every

275

time I have to go on my phone

276
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,471
or whether it rings or --

277

or you trippin' out

00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:30,272
when I come home late.

279
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:31,307
It's like you have a problem

280
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,308
with the success of me

281
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:33,542
and my business.

282
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:34,443
No.

283
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:35,778
I have a problem with the fact

284
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,379
that we don't spend quality time

285
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,714
together, Omar.

286
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,216
And I don't think that's asking

287
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,383
too much.

288
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,384
Seriously, it's like you have

a better relationship

Look, all I need from you

297
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:54,497
is some more attention.

298
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:55,931

Okay. [ Laughs ]

I didn't plan that.

You did plan -- I think you

did plan it.

you know there was a study done

that pets can improve marriages

315
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:23,926
and relationships?

316
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,594
Maybe -- maybe you guys

317
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:26,829
should consider getting one,

318
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:27,763

So we can't even get a pet.

we did one of those.

Okay, well --

334
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,315
well then, here's what you do.

335
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,918
Just -- just pack his clothes

336
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,920
and throw it in the trunk, okay?

337
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,654
And then, tell him

338

that you want to go somewhere

And then, just mysteriously

end up at the airport

That's how you do it.

00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:01,263
Mmm, Tahiti, yes!

345
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:01,864

Yes.

00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,867
Samira, I'm flyin' my butt to

349
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:05,668
divorce court.

350
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:06,368
Mnh-mnh.

351
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:07,603
Oh, y'all don't find that

352
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:07,937
funny?

353
00:10:07,937 --> 00:10:09,505
I don't find it funny at all.

354
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:10,739
Just a little joke. Okay.

355
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:11,440
Unh-unh.

356
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,007
All right.

357
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,676
You need to get on that

358
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,610
vacation...

359
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,277
Yes.

360
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,512
And force that excitement and

361
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:17,713
the adventure right out of that

362
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:18,781
black man -- you can do it.

363
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,015
Stop, that's what I'm talkin'

364
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:20,516
about.

365
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:22,585
That's what I'm talking about.

366
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:24,486
Shoot, make me want to go home

367
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:25,721
to my husband and just get it

368
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:26,021
in.

369
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,289
What --

370
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,390
What, did you...

371
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,959
It's just too bad he's at work.

372
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:30,893
Gonna get it?

373
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,829
Yeah! I'm gonna get it!

374
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:36,498
Omar and I, we --

375
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,866
We haven't, uh, gotten it in a

376
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,335
couple months.

377
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:42,871
Was that months with an S?

378
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:43,639
Like, plural.

379
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,974
With an S.

380
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:45,708
Yes.

381
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:46,508
That's a shock value.

382
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,276
More than two?

383
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:47,776
No.

384
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:48,611
'Cause it's workin'.

385
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:49,578
This shock value is definitely

386
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:50,012
workin'.

387
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,313
No, I'm so serious,

388
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:52,848
like, I'm dead serious.

389
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:54,350
Yeah. I mean,

390
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,852
don't judge me with those faces.

391
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:57,786
When you guys get 8 years in

392
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:58,821
your relationship, and, I

393
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,322
mean...

394
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:01,423
I guess marriages sometimes just

395
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:01,824
get rocky.

396
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:02,992
Uh, well, you know

397
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:06,462
I had my issues with my husband.

398
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,863
I mean, I --

399
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,865
I was gonna do somethin' really

400
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:10,766
bad, like, really, really bad.

401
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:12,034
I was gonna be on the special

402
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,702
edition of "48 Hours."

403
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:15,604
Like, yes, I mean,

404
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:16,839
I was facing 25 to life

405
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,340
on principle alone.

406
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,875
But what did you do?

407
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,477
You put on that cape.

408
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:21,877
And you came

409
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,479
and saved Damon's life.

410
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,613
That's what you did,

411
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:25,414
took all the guns

412
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,082
and knives out my house.

413
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:29,852
But you did that for us.

414
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:31,487
And I just know you can get

415
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:32,621
through this with ease.

416
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,523
Yes, girl, yes.

417
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,459
Look, you and Omar have been

418
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,094
a great example

419
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:41,030
for me and Jahaad.

420
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,931
Wow. I didn't know

421
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:43,999
you guys felt that way.

422
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,633
Yeah.

423
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,934
Well, listen, heifers, it's

424
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,336
time for you to put on your

425
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:47,836
capes.

426
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,705
Well then, uh, girlfriend

427
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:51,507

428
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:52,374
United!

429
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:53,075
Exactly.

430
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,476
Capes unite.

431
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:58,113
I love y'all.

432
00:11:58,113 --> 00:12:01,817
Mmm, this is good.

433
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,519
I appreciate you comin' home

434
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,020
early for dinner.

435
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,388
You know, I heard you the

436
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:07,089
other night.

437
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:08,557
I was listenin', and you're

438
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,591
right.

439
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,795
I'm sorry.

440
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,397
Thanks, babe. So...

441
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,398
Mm-hmm?

442
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:17,833
...I was thinking.

443
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,001
We have not been on a vacation

444
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:19,835
in quite a while.

445
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:20,903
Mmm.

446
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:21,937
And the girls just happened

447
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:23,505
to be talkin' about Tahiti.

448
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,407
What do you think about that?

449
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:26,608
Dope. Tahiti sounds dope.

450
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:26,975
Yeah?

451
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,143
Yeah. I'll mess with Tahiti.

452
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,078
You know, as long as they got

453
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:30,713
Wi-Fi, I'm good. [ Chuckles ]

454
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:31,580
Oh, gosh.

455
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,114
I'm playin'.

456
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:33,115
That's okay.

457
00:12:33,115 --> 00:12:34,550
I mean, is there someplace else

458
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,818
you'd rather go?

459
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,954
Um, we could always go back

460
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:40,389
to Cancun.

461
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:41,090
Mmm, I don't think we're

462
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,957
allowed back there.

463
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:45,594
We've been banned from a couple

464
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,562
of places.

465
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,162
Yeah, we have.

That balcony...

471
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:53,569
Not my fault.

472
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,837
Well, you and that dark

00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:17,152
[ Clears throat ] Okay.

522
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:18,754
Then can you please

523
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:22,224
put your phone away because

524
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:24,059
this is supposed to be my time.

525
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,093
Remember that little promise

526
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:25,994
you made me today?

527
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:30,732
My time.

528
00:14:30,732 --> 00:14:33,635
Phone stays where it is.

529
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:38,607
Now...

530
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:41,643
What about that vacation?

531
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,081
It's all itemized.

532
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,115
If you guys look at, uh,

533
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:48,584
line 29, you'll see how much you

534
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:49,685
made off your investments

535
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,053
in the, uh, 770 accounts.

536
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,688
If you guys have any questions,

537
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:53,689
e-mail me.

538
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,123
Mmm, nah, nah, we good.

539
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,191
We good. Thank you. Thank you.

540
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,960
First of all, thank you for

541
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,827
givin' us the opportunity

542
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:00,062
to invest in your, you know,

543
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:01,029
urban development program.

544
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:01,930
Thanks, bro.

545
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,698
Yeah.

546
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:03,532
No, it's cool.

547
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:07,035
But, uh, you good?

548
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:08,170
Yeah, I'm cool.

549
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,840
Sure, man?

550
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,275
Okay, it's Carmen.

551
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,210
Like, she's been trippin'

552
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,278
lately, man.

553
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:17,846
Like, the other night, she

554
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:18,914
dropped my phone in a glass of

555
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:19,915
water.

556
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:20,582
Mmm.

557
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,917
That ain't trippin', man.

558
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:22,885
That's crazy.

559
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:23,852
She's been, like, complainin'

560
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,687
and naggin', tryin' to bait me

561
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:26,889
into arguments.

562
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:27,956
I -- I -- I don't know, guys.

563
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:29,291
I'm just gettin' sick of it.

564
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,727
I'm gettin' sick of it.

565
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:32,694
All right. Look, if you --

566
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:33,996
if you want an outside opinion

567
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:35,163
on your marriage, and you're

568
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:38,000
ready to, you know, listen,

569
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,036
you can handle it, let me know.

570
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,138
So you Dr. Phil now?

571
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,173
No, no, uh, I'm not Dr. Phil.

572
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,575
I'm just sayin', look,

573
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:48,310
honestly, no disrespect, right?

574
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,245
When we go out as couples,

575
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:50,979
Jasmine, you know,

576
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,648
she all on my lap.

577
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:53,849
Samira, she all on his shoulder.

578
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:54,850
You know, you and Carmen,

579
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,951
you on one side of the room.

580
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:56,752
Way over there.

581
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:57,653
She on the other.

582
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:58,754
For real, it's like the other

583
00:15:58,754 --> 00:15:59,721
night, like, game night.

584
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:00,923
Y'all look like y'all was about

585
00:16:00,923 --> 00:16:01,924
to have a boxing match or

586
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:02,324
somethin'.

587
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:02,925
No, no.

588
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,892
I'm tellin' you. Look --

589
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,327
Look, whatever, man. look.

590
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,995
That's your wife, right?

591
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:08,597
All she wants is affection.

592
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:09,231
That's it.

593
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,666
How you think she feels if she

594
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:11,934
see us with our wives and -- and

595
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,101
you over there in the corner on

596
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,169
your phone?

597
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,203
On that phone, man.

598
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,371
Okay, now, you're just makin'

599
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,673
stuff up.

600
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:18,340
I'm makin' it up?

601
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,741
Oh, I'm -- I'm tryin' to holla

602
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:20,776
at you from a place of love,

603
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:21,076
right?

604
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:22,644
When the last time you tap that?

605
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:23,812
Dude, that's...

606
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:24,980
When the last time?

607
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,048
Disrespectful, man.

608
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,082
What?

609
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:28,116
Dude, you ain't got no chill.

610
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:29,217
So disrespectful.

611
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,319
Why you all up in the man's

612
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,186
business?

613
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:32,054
I'm just sayin', look, I

614
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,322
remember her, like, walkin'

615
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,222
around, right, with the...

616
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:35,190
She actin' like -- she looked

617
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,024
like she was full of life.

618
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:36,858
She had a glow.

619
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:37,793
She had this light about her.

620
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:38,961
Now, she -- she got this sad

621
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:39,795
face all the time.

622
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:40,729
Like, she, you know,

623
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:41,830
mean-muggin' us and stuff.

624
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,031
Look, enough about my wife,

625
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:43,665
all right?

626
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:44,766
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

627
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:45,667
Look, I'm just sayin'.

628
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,002
That's your wife, right?

629
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:47,736
She's a woman.

630
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:48,937
She needs attention -- you know,

631
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,072
she's like a little flower.

632
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,273
You got to water it, show it --

633
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:52,407
show it attention, love, and

634
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,041
affection.

635
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,309
She wants that from her husband.

636
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,711
I'm tellin' you, you better do

637
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:56,878
that 'cause there's a lot of

638
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,113
thirsty dudes out there in the

639
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:58,714
streets.

640
00:16:58,714 --> 00:16:59,414
They could see her comin' from

641
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,415
100 miles away.

642
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,249
Whatever, man.

643
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:05,387
It's whatever?

644
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:06,288
It's not -- I mean, that's

645
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,289
not what I mean.

646
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:08,256
That's not what I'm sayin'.

647
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,324
I see it.

648
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,058
Yeah, yeah.

649
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,326
You got a little side piece.

650
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,694
You got the side joint?

651
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:16,298
What? No! I love Carmen.

652
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,666
To tell you the truth, I can't

653
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,400
remember the last time we got

654
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,170
busy.

655
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,139
What? What's that?

656
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,674
Can't remember?

657
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:26,808
That's not cool, dude.

658
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:27,709
That's no bueno, dude.

659
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,178
That's -- that's no good, homey.

660
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,780
That's bad. That's real bad.

661
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,183
No married man should go 3 days

662
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:36,918
without havin' sex with his

663
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:37,219
wife.

664
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:37,853
Mnh-mnh.

665
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:38,387
Real talk.

666
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,254
I'm just keepin' it real.

667
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:40,689
You ask me when's the last time

668
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:41,723
me and Jasmine did it, I'm gonna

669
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:43,792
be like, "About an hour ago,

670
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,161
Unh, aye, yeah!"

671
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,095
You ask me when we doin' it

672
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,030
again, I'm gonna be like,

673
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,997
"As soon as she pick me up,

674
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:50,032
we gonna stop at McDonald's"...

675
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:50,999
Look, D, I don't want to hear

676
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:52,034
about your sex life with you

677
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,435
and your wife, all right?

678
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:54,703
All right, look, I don't care

679
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:55,837
what you do with your wife.

680
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:56,805
And I don't care what you do

681
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:57,439
with your wife.

682
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,373
All right? I've been focusin'

683
00:17:58,373 --> 00:17:59,441
on my business, and that's

684
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,776
probably the reason why I

685
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:02,010
haven't been thinkin' about sex.

686
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,145
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

687
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:04,112
If you havin' problems

688
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:05,280
down there, I mean, you should

689
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,415

00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,702
Wow.

1034
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:43,004
Sorry to hear that about Carmen

1035
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:44,038
and Omar.

1036
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:44,839
That's crazy.

1037
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,574
Yeah, it's crazy.

1038
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:49,877
It's just a huge wake-up call.

1039
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:55,817
Look at me.

1040
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:58,085
I'm here, all right?

1041
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,254
I ain't going nowhere.

1042
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:02,857
You understand? You understand?

1043
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:06,027
Yes.

1044
00:31:06,027 --> 00:31:08,696
Good night.

1045
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:14,902
Give me some covers.

1046
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,145
We go to people's weddings.

1047
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:24,712
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:25,279
We throw rice.

1049
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,047
We celebrate them.

1050
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,148
And then where are we for them

1051
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:28,282
when it's time for them to talk

1052
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:29,250
about getting a divorce?

1053
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,284
The...are you talking

You know what I'm talking

about.

1057

Carmen loves this man.

1058
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:34,622
I need you to talk to him today.

1059
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:35,022
Okay.

1060
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,224
Don't just, "Okay," me,

Damon -- I'm serious.

1062
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:38,526
I said, "All right."

1063
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:39,694
Shut up and give me a kiss

1064

before you go to work.

1065

Yeah -- Oh, girl, please.

1070
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:46,868
My back, I can't take it.

I did not call you trash.

I didn't mean it like that.

All right, so, what am I

1186
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,465
supposed to do with all these

papers?

1188
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,300
Just take them to your

1189
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,869
attorney and let him look over

1190
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,237
them, and then, you can bring

1191
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:38,239
them to our lunch date.

1192

I like how you slid that in.

00:34:58,325 --> 00:34:59,927
Well, um,

1204
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:01,762
so I went past your place today,

1205
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:03,364
and it's probably gonna be,

1206
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:05,199
like, a week before everything

1207
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:05,933
is done.

1208
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:06,967
No!

1209
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:07,868
Yes. I know.

1210
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:10,071
No! Oh, man.

1211
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:11,138
I've already told Omar I was

1212
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:12,239
gonna move out a couple of days

1213
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,240
ago.

1214
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,775
Do you know when it's gonna be

1215
00:35:14,775 --> 00:35:18,245
ready?

1216
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:19,480
Should be ready by Wednesday,

1217
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,182
but, um -- That's all right!

1218
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:24,051
That's all right. I got an idea.

1219
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,252
If it's too much problem with

1220
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:26,420
you being here with Mr. Wright,

1221
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,456
I mean, I have a few extra rooms

1222
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:29,056
at my place.

1223
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:32,393
You can always stay there.

1224
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:33,294
Really?

1225
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:33,994
What?

1226
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:34,829
I can't do that.

1227
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:36,397
You're not holding up this

1228
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:37,798
process to make me stay with

1229
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:38,232
you, right?

1230
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,200
I would never ever do

1231
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,934
anything like that.

1232
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:40,768
Just checking.

1233
00:35:40,768 --> 00:35:41,535
But it does sound like a

1234
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:43,404
pretty good idea.

1235
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,338
No, really, sweetie, I just

1236
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:46,307
want to -- just want to help

1237
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:47,141
you, that's all.

1238
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:50,144
Thank you.

1239
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,145
So listen, I know

1240
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:53,047
it's a pretty difficult time,

1241
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:54,815
and probably even a premature

1242
00:35:54,815 --> 00:35:57,818
time to ask, but why don't you

1243
00:35:57,818 --> 00:36:01,288
let me take you to dinner?

1244
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:02,289
[ Door opens ]

1245
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,891
Wright, sir!

1246
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:05,159
How you doing, man?

1247
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,893
I'm good.

1248
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:06,527
Good, good. Good.

1249
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,028
I had to drop some papers off.

1250
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:09,163
I hope that's okay with you.

1251
00:36:09,163 --> 00:36:10,531
Okay. Yeah, it's cool.

1252
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,465
How you doing?

1253
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:13,334
I'm good. I'm good, I'm good.

1254
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:14,935
It's amazing what you guys

1255
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:17,138
did to the house, man.

1256
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:18,405
It's absolutely beautiful.

1257
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:19,807
Yeah, well, you know,

1258
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,208
we got taste. We're not slobs.

1259
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,810
Well, I guess I'll be going

1260
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,110
now.

1261
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,445
Ms. Wright, think about that

1262
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:25,212
offer, okay?

1263
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:25,946
I will.

1264
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:27,248
All right, now, thank you

1265
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:28,115
for your time.

1266
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:28,916
Thank you.

1267
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:29,517
Mr. Wright.

1268
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:30,317
Always a pleasure, sir.

1269
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:30,951
Yes, sir.

1270
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:31,385
Yes, sir.

1271
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:32,920
You guys have a good one, okay?

1272
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,021
You know what,

1273
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,189
let me get the door for you.

1274
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:37,825
Excuse me, honey.

1275
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,128
All right, brother.

1276
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:42,263
All right, sir.

1277
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:44,031
Yeah. Have a good one.

1278
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:47,401
You, as well.

1279
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:50,070
Really?

1280
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:56,210
See, that's what I'm talking

1281
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,877
about!

1282
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:59,380
Yo, that...me off, man.

1283
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,214
I'm telling you.

1284
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:01,482
I hate that snake dudes, right,

1285
00:37:01,482 --> 00:37:02,616
just -- just chilling in the

1286
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:03,350
cut, lurking.

1287
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,585
Do you not care that your wife

1288
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:05,853
could be cheating on you?

1289
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,054
I know my wife better than

1290
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:07,621
you, all right?

1291
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:08,522
Just remember that.

1292
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:09,857
No, I'm just saying, why

1293
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:11,091
am I more...off than you?

1294
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:11,592
Just saying.

1295
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:12,626
No, 'cause you always

1296
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:13,260
overreact.

1297
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,961
Uh, what?

1298
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:14,929
No, you overreact.

1299
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:15,996
I'm going to my lawyer today,

1300
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,064
getting those divorce papers,

1301
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:18,132
giving them to Carmen --

1302
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,400
Whatever makes her happy.

1303
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,968
Who is she, man?

1304
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:22,102
Boom.

1305
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:23,103
Yo, that's what I'm saying.

1306
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:24,271
Who's who?

1307
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:24,939
Who's who?

1308
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,908
Hoo hoo! What are you, an owl?

1309
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:31,579
Who is she? Or who's he?

1310
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:32,379
Shut up.

1311
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:33,514
I mean, this is Atlanta.

1312
00:37:33,514 --> 00:37:35,049
No, you so stupid, all right?

1313
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:35,449
Atlanta.

1314
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:36,383
Well, if you're referring

1315
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:38,152
to Kareena, she's just a friend.

1316
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:38,586
A colleague,

1317
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:39,887
someone who I work with.

1318
00:37:39,887 --> 00:37:40,955
♪ But you say she just a

1319
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:41,355
friend ♪

1320
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,523
Now the truth comes out.

1321
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:43,591
But you say -- yeah.

1322
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:44,558
Yeah. You see it?

1323
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:46,093
Okay, listen. For the record,

1324
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:47,194
I haven't slept with her.

1325
00:37:47,194 --> 00:37:47,595
Okay.

1326
00:37:47,595 --> 00:37:48,996
All right -- no, if I --

1327
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:50,197
if I did, I would have told you!

1328
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:51,365
Look, see, all this time

1329
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:52,666
we thinking it's her, and it's

1330
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:53,234
this dude.

1331
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:53,901
Mm-hmm.

1332
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:54,668
Well, she is bad.

1333
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:55,269
Yeah?

1334
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,370
But, you know, when me

1335
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,438
and Carmen got married,

1336
00:37:57,438 --> 00:37:58,606
I was about my baby, man.

1337
00:37:58,606 --> 00:37:59,240
You know?

1338
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,641
It was like that for my parents,

1339
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,009
I thought it was gonna be

1340
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:02,910
like that for me.

1341
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,278
Okay, so, after the divorce,

1342
00:38:04,278 --> 00:38:05,179
you gonna hit it?

1343
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:06,213
Man, I don't know!

1344
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:08,115
God, what is wrong with this

1345
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:08,415
guy?

1346
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:10,551
No! Listen.

1347
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:11,418
Since I been married,

1348
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:13,153
Carmen's all I've ever known.

1349
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:15,522
Okay?

1350
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:16,657
I don't know, maybe you guys are

1351
00:38:16,657 --> 00:38:17,358
right.

1352
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:18,158
Maybe it's time to start

1353
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:21,962
looking towards new things.

1354
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:23,964
Have you guys ever cheated?

1355
00:38:23,964 --> 00:38:25,633
You know, I've thought about

1356
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:26,100
it.

1357
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,067
With this little honey dip at

1358
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,502
work, man.

1359
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:30,170
Was fine, too, but, I --

1360
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,306
I -- I had to nip that.

1361
00:38:32,306 --> 00:38:35,075
Nip that in the bud.

1362
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:38,445
What?

1363
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:41,048
...please. Right?

1364
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:42,483
Right. "I had to --

1365
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:43,617
I had to nip it in the bud."

1366
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:45,352
You bit her in the butt is what

1367
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:46,520
you did -- don't act like you

1368
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,055
wasn't -- stop playing, man.

1369
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:49,356
To tell you the truth,

1370
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:50,591
tell you the truth, I think

1371
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:52,026
about it all the time.

1372
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:53,093
...yeah. Plenty of times, man.

1373
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,595
Matter of fact, on the way over

1374
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,096
here, I, you know, was driving.

1375
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,131
I seen two little shorties cross

1376
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:58,165
the street, looking like

1377
00:38:58,165 --> 00:38:59,033
Laverne and Shirley.

1378
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:00,467
I was like, boom, immediately,

1379
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,602
thought popped into my head,

1380
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:03,137
right?

1381
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:03,704
See, that's what I do.

1382
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:05,339
I let my thoughts play out.

1383
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,640
For a very long time.

1384
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,341
See, I ain't never

1385
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:09,176
physically cheated.

1386
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:11,145
But in my mind? I'm a ho.

1387
00:39:11,145 --> 00:39:11,612
Yeah.

1388
00:39:11,612 --> 00:39:13,147
And for that very reason,

1389
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:14,315
I know I'm going to...

1390
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:15,215
Yeah, absolutely.

1391
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:16,317
See, me and the devil,

1392
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:17,718
we on a first-name basis,

1393
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,286
you know what I'm saying?

1394
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:20,187
He got my cell phone. Hold up.

1395
00:39:20,187 --> 00:39:21,221
I think he texting me right now.

1396
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:24,491
Hold on. Let me see.

1397
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:25,759
Yes, Lucifer. Yes.

1398
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:28,162
What is wrong with you, man?

1399
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:29,330
Nah, I'm playing.

1400
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,264
But yo, I-I understand what

1401
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,532
you're saying, man.

1402
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:32,399
I love my wife, too.

1403
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,367
But it's hard, you know what I'm

1404
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:33,701
saying?

1405
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,668
How you gonna not think about

1406
00:39:34,668 --> 00:39:35,769
it, at least?

1407
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:38,639
Well, Carmen's my first love.

1408
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,008
And I thought she'd be my last.

1409
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,309
Look, I've been a loyal husband!

1410
00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:43,243
Okay?

1411
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:44,211
Like, when we went to the altar,

1412
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:45,112
and we saying our vows, man,

1413
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:46,013
I meant it -- I meant it.

1414
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:48,115
Yeah. At that time.

1415
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:48,515
We all do.

1416
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:49,149
No, I did!

1417
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:51,151
I know. Then, yeah, I did

1418
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:51,585
too!

1419
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:52,319
I still do!

1420
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:53,187
And I think she did, too,

1421
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,655
but now it doesn't matter.

1422
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:55,522
So if anyone's cheating,

1423
00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:56,623
it's probably me.

1424
00:39:56,623 --> 00:39:57,658
I cheated Carmen out of being

1425
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:58,792
number one, man. Your wife?

1426
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,260
Should not have to compete

1427
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,629
with anyone or anything.

1428
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:04,698
So focused on my business, I

1429
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:05,766
lost sight of what's important.

1430
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:06,533
You know what's crazy?

1431
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,268
Carmen helped me start the

1432
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:09,503
business.

1433
00:40:09,503 --> 00:40:11,271
I messed up, fellas.

1434
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:12,673
What about counseling?

1435
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:14,074
You guys ever thought about

1436
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:14,375
that?

1437
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,542
Nah, I think it's too late

1438
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:16,276
for that, man.

1439
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:17,444
She don't want nothing to do

1440
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:17,811
with me.

1441
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:18,679
Plus. those counselors, they

1442
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:20,047
don't know -- they don't know

1443
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:20,748
you, they don't know what they

1444
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:21,448
talking about.

1445
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:22,816
It's like, I wish I could just

1446
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:24,084
go back to the beginning and

1447
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:25,252
start over.

1448
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:27,154
Not having Carmen by my side,

1449
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:27,821
man, I feel like I'm out of

1450
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,556
business.

1451
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:31,625
Yeah.

1452
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,460
So -- So, next week,

1453
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,828
after the divorce.

1454
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:36,263
You still gonna hit?

1455
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:37,398
Man, shut up, Damon.

1456
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:38,399
What is -- Ugh.

1457
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,400
Just saying.

1458
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,101
I can't with you. I can't.

1459
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:42,403
Just trying to live.

1460
00:40:42,403 --> 00:40:44,438
Can a brother live?

1461
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:45,406
Hmm, so, thank you

1462
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:46,774
for bringing me to lunch.

1463
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:48,242
No problem!

1464
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:49,576
I know this is about more

1465
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,078
than lunch, because not often

1466
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,579
do you ask me out

1467
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,648
in the middle of the week.

1468
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:57,618
That bozo August?

1469
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,319
He asked if I'd like to stay

1470
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,087
in his spare room

1471
00:41:00,087 --> 00:41:02,222
until my place is ready.

1472
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:04,324
And you said?

1473
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:06,126
Well, I told him no.

1474
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:07,161
But the more I think about it,

1475
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,629
I should take him up on his

1476
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:09,863
offer.

1477
00:41:09,863 --> 00:41:11,665
Um, Samira and I both have

1478
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:12,666
rooms that you can stay in.

1479
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:13,667
So you're fine.

1480
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,102
I know. I know, but the thing

1481
00:41:15,102 --> 00:41:16,336
is, I don't want to impose on my

1482
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:17,171
best friends and your

1483
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:18,472
relationships just because mine

1484
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:19,573
is in the can.

1485
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:21,141
Um, ma'am.

1486
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,376
Do you hear yourself?

1487
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,644
'Cause you sound crazy.

1488
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:24,678
You will stay with us.

1489
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:26,113
Oh, no, but you know what,

1490
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,314
if you do stay with him, let

1491
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:28,682
me tell you how it's gonna go.

1492
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:29,616
Oh, you're gonna get there,

1493
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:30,884
y'all gonna cuddle.

1494
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,352
You gonna spoon with him

1495
00:41:32,352 --> 00:41:33,320
a little bit.

1496
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,321
Then you're gonna have sex with

1497
00:41:34,321 --> 00:41:35,456
him, then you're gonna become

1498
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,357
another notch on his belt.

1499
00:41:37,357 --> 00:41:38,258
And then, boom!

1500
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:39,359
He's gonna throw you out

1501
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,327
like an orange peel.

1502
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:42,830
Carmen, you are slipping.

1503
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,764
Really, Jasmine?

1504
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,365
That's a lot.

1505
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:47,301
What do you mean, I'm slipping?

1506
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:49,169
You have completely lost your

1507
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:49,470
mind!

1508
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,238
Do you hear yourself?

1509
00:41:51,238 --> 00:41:53,707
that fool should have not even

1510
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:55,509
had the audacity or the balls,

1511
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:57,478
even, to ask you any mess like

1512
00:41:57,478 --> 00:41:58,212
that.

1513
00:41:58,212 --> 00:41:59,346
The Carmen that I know, love,

1514
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:00,881
and admire for the amazing woman

1515
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:02,282
that she is would have

1516
00:42:02,282 --> 00:42:05,252
told him off very kind-like.

1517
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,220
I just don't want to impose

1518
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,321
on you and Samira.

1519
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:08,255
Plus, I don't have the money

1520
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,156
for a hotel right now.

1521
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:09,590
I mean,

1522
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,458
I'm giving Omar everything.

1523
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,459
That's just as much

1524
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,295
your house as it is Omar's.

1525
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:16,463
You sleep in the bed,

1526
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:18,532
and put him on the couch.

1527
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:21,401
Did Omar ask you to leave?

1528
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:22,503
No.

1529
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:22,903
Oh, good,

1530
00:42:22,903 --> 00:42:24,605
'cause he know I'm crazy.

1531
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,772
I'm sure Damon has told him

1532
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:27,174
a whole lot of stories about me.

1533
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:28,475
I mean, but my marriage

1534
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:30,444
is practically over, right?

1535
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:31,678
I don't see the problem in me

1536
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:34,381
taking that man up on his offer.

1537
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:35,816
Do you hear the insanity

1538
00:42:35,816 --> 00:42:37,417
that continues to spew out

1539
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:38,652

1710
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:20,787
breakfast next time.

1711
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:21,721
Okay.

1712
00:49:21,721 --> 00:49:22,822
Have a good one.

1713
00:49:22,822 --> 00:49:26,793
You too.

1714
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:33,934
So, thanks for signing

1715
00:49:33,934 --> 00:49:35,235
the rest of the papers.

1716
00:49:35,235 --> 00:49:36,269
We should have you squared away

1717
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:37,170
in a few days.

1718
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,738
Oh, finally. Thank you.

1719
00:49:38,738 --> 00:49:40,707
Yeah.

1720
00:49:40,707 --> 00:49:43,043
But, thank you for this

1721
00:49:43,043 --> 00:49:43,677
breakfast.

1722
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:44,811
It is absolutely delicious.

1723
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:48,148
You're welcome.

1724
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:51,685
Listen, I really appreciate

1725
00:49:51,685 --> 00:49:53,887
this and all, but, uh, how about

1726
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:55,021
that dinner we talked about?

1727
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:55,755
Okay, this isn't

1728
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:56,656
a breakfast date, August.

1729
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:58,024
It's just leftovers.

1730
00:49:58,024 --> 00:49:59,025
Just, you know,

1731
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:00,794
not made for you, specifically.

1732
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:02,162
Mm-hmm.

1733
00:50:02,162 --> 00:50:03,897
Just me being thoughtful.

1734
00:50:03,897 --> 00:50:06,299
Bit of my Southern hospitality.

1735
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:10,303
Okay, um. Dinner?

1736
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,938
You keep stressing

1737
00:50:11,938 --> 00:50:12,772
this dinner thing.

1738
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:13,373
Yes, because dinner

1739
00:50:13,373 --> 00:50:15,308
ain't never killed nobody.

1740
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:16,242
Well, I watch the news,

1741
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:18,144
and it's gotten a couple people

1742
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:19,913
killed, dinner. [ Laughs ]

1743
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:20,914
Yes, dinner.

1744
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:22,015
And don't make me beg, because

1745
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:25,685
it don't look good on my résumé.

1746
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:26,953
Okay.

1747
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:29,889
Well, I mean, it's just dinner.

1748
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:32,392
Mm-hmm. Just dinner.

1749
00:50:32,392 --> 00:50:35,061
Yeah, I mean...I've been

1750
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:36,730
stressed a lot, so, uh, I could

1751
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,931
use a night on the town.

1752
00:50:37,931 --> 00:50:39,733
Why not? It's just dinner.

1753
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:40,967
Yeah, let's -- let's --

1754
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:42,335
Let's do dinner.

1755
00:50:42,335 --> 00:50:43,937
But we're gonna do it Dutch.

1756
00:50:43,937 --> 00:50:45,205
Please, Dutch is not

1757
00:50:45,205 --> 00:50:45,805
an option.

1758
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:47,007
Oh, come on, isn't that what

1759
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,008
the cool kids do these days?

1760
00:50:48,008 --> 00:50:50,377
Mnh-mnh. Not an option, lady.

1761
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:52,345
Okay. But you cannot

1762
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,947
come pick me up here, okay?

1763
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:55,115
That would not be a good idea

1764
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:57,017
with Mr. Wright.

1765
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:59,085
7:00?

1766
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:00,220
7:00 it is.

1767
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,688
Tell you what.

1768
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:03,456
I'm gonna text you a time and a

1769
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:05,225
location in about an hour.

1770
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:05,992
Okay.

1771
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:06,993
All right?

1772
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:07,360
Mm-hmm.

1773
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,695
Let's shake on it.

1774
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:11,698
Let's shake on it.

1775
00:51:11,698 --> 00:51:13,700
You all right with me.

1776
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,169
[ Chuckles ]

1777
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:22,242
Hey, Noelle, how's that, uh,

1778
00:51:22,242 --> 00:51:23,710
fall program going?

1779
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,378
It's good. Here's your mail.

1780
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:29,249
Thank you.

1781
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:30,850
What's going on?

1782
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,886
Why you sitting out here

1783
00:51:32,886 --> 00:51:34,254
looking all sad?

1784
00:51:34,254 --> 00:51:35,755
Is it true?

1785
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:38,491
Is what true?

1786
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:39,993
You and Mr. Wright are

1787
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:43,096
getting a divorce?

1788
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:45,098
I -- I wasn't eavesdropping.

1789
00:51:45,098 --> 00:51:47,400
I just heard you guys talking

1790
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,401
when I was coming up from the

1791
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:52,305
basement.

1792
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:55,475
So, is it true?

1793
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:57,777
Yeah. It's true.

1794
00:51:57,777 --> 00:51:58,745
But why?

1795
00:51:58,745 --> 00:52:01,848
I guess sometimes people

1796
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:04,751
just fall out of being in love.

1797
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:05,752
Like my dad and Ms. Louis?

1798
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:07,787
I don't know.

1799
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:08,488
What's going on with your dad

1800
00:52:08,488 --> 00:52:10,890
and Ms. Louis?

1801
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,058
They had this big argument

1802
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:14,894
about my dad loving my mom,

1803
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:16,830
but I don't understand.

1804
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,031
I understand.

1805
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:19,999
See, it's probably a lot more

1806
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:21,801
than just about your dad

1807
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:24,771
loving your mom.

1808
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,339
Love and being in love --

1809
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:27,307
two totally different things

1810
00:52:27,307 --> 00:52:29,909
to us grown folks.

1811
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:32,045
So, wait.

1812
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:33,346
Your dad's dating Ms. Louis?

1813
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:34,013
Yeah.

1814
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:35,248
So why don't you just

1815
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,382
sometimes go down to her place

1816
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:37,851
when you're locked out?

1817
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:39,552
She's only a few doors down.

1818
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:41,187
Because I like being

1819
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:43,289
around you and Mr. Wright.

1820
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:46,326
It's fun being in a two-parent

1821
00:52:46,326 --> 00:52:48,928
household.

1822
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:50,330
And I know you guys

1823
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,865
don't have the perfect marriage,

1824
00:52:51,865 --> 00:52:54,167
but I see how you guys look

1825
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,935
at each other, Ms. Wright.

1826
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,305
And that's love.

1827
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:01,074
But why don't marriages ever

1828
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:02,075
work out?

1829
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:03,076
No, come here.

1830
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,477
Look at me. Now, look.

1831
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:05,945
I know your parents had a

1832
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:07,180
divorce and I know that

1833
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,548
Mr. Wright and I are going

1834
00:53:08,548 --> 00:53:10,250
through a divorce, but there are

1835
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,351
plenty of marriages out there

1836
00:53:11,351 --> 00:53:12,252
that work.

1837
00:53:12,252 --> 00:53:13,353
It's just that both parties have

1838
00:53:13,353 --> 00:53:15,355
to be willing to work at it.

1839
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:16,089
You understand?

1840
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:18,424
Yeah.

1841
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:19,425
Ms. Wright?

1842
00:53:19,425 --> 00:53:21,127
Yes, ma'am.

1843
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:23,563
Mr. Wright is a good person.

1844
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,865
And he teaches me a lot about

1845
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:27,267
life.

1846
00:53:27,267 --> 00:53:29,836
Can you please just take him

1847
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:31,037
back and show me that marriages

1848
00:53:31,037 --> 00:53:32,605
work?

1849
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:37,911

Kareena, sweetheart,

1856

I would like to thank you again,

on a job well done.

1858

Uh-huh. You rock.

1859
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,032
You know, Peter's still

hounding me about that answer

1861

from you.

I'm gonna take it.

You are?

1864
00:54:03,336 --> 00:54:05,004
Mm-hmm.

1865
00:54:05,004 --> 00:54:05,939
Yep, I already put my house

1866

okay?

Well, then I guess I should

1873
00:54:16,115 --> 00:54:17,550
thank you for leaving me

2048
00:59:51,851 --> 00:59:53,886
I just, uh, I didn't want

2049
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:55,621
to steer away from plans.

2050
00:59:55,621 --> 01:00:01,527
I just kept packing.

2051
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:04,363
So you're taking the dishes?

2052
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:05,565
Because I thought you said

2053
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:06,465
you weren't taking anything

2054
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:06,966
outside the house

2055
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:07,767
except your clothes.

2056
01:00:07,767 --> 01:00:08,801
Well, I don't have to take

2057
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:10,236
the dishes, if that's a problem.

2058
01:00:10,236 --> 01:00:11,571
No. No, baby, it's cool.

2059
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:12,805
I mean, if you need them, take

2060
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:14,574
them.

2061
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:15,508
I'm just saying, whatever you

2062
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:16,576
take, just let me know

2063
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:17,510
because I'm gonna have Kareena

2064
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:20,379
put most of this stuff on eBay.

2065
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:21,681
I'm so tired of hearing

2066
01:00:21,681 --> 01:00:23,416
that name.

2067
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,850
Um, why are you selling things

2068
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:27,520
on eBay?

2069
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,523
I'm selling the house.

2070
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:31,724
This house?

2071
01:00:31,724 --> 01:00:32,592
Yeah.

2072
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:34,594
Why are you selling our

2073
01:00:34,594 --> 01:00:37,563
house?

2074
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:40,833
Peter made me an offer

2075
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:43,803
and asked if I would take

2076
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:47,707
Wrights Investments to Europe.

2077
01:00:47,707 --> 01:00:51,477
I said yes.

2078
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:51,944
Wow.

2079
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:56,782
I leave next month.

2080
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:04,290
Congratulations.

2081
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,458
You're finally able to go

2082
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,427
to Europe.

2083
01:01:08,427 --> 01:01:10,696
I'm sure that, uh, that success

2084
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:14,734
should make you happy.

2085
01:01:14,734 --> 01:01:16,669
How long, um...

2086
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:17,603
How long was this offer

2087
01:01:17,603 --> 01:01:18,971
on the table?

2088
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:20,039
A few days after you gave me

2089
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,807
those divorce papers.

2090
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:22,675
So that's why you didn't

2091
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:25,011
put up a fight to sign them.

2092
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,050
Well, have fun in Europe.

2093
01:02:50,429 --> 01:02:51,063
Finally done.

2094
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:55,668
Yes, yes, yes.

2095
01:02:55,668 --> 01:03:00,473
This is, like, so surreal.

2096
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:04,543
What is?

2097
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:07,847
This.

2098
01:03:07,847 --> 01:03:09,181
Oh, August.

2099
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:12,051
Um, we should probably talk.

2100
01:03:12,051 --> 01:03:13,819
Okay, well, talk.

2101
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:15,521
Look, I don't want to mislead

2102
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:16,422
you or anything.

2103
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:17,623
No! I really think you're a nice

2104
01:03:17,623 --> 01:03:20,192
guy, but this all pulling me in

2105
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:21,894
and getting close, that's a

2106
01:03:21,894 --> 01:03:22,928
little too soon, it's a bit

2107
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:24,563
much.

2108
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:25,531
So how much time do you need

2109
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:26,532
me to give you?

2110
01:03:26,532 --> 01:03:27,466
That's the thing.

2111
01:03:27,466 --> 01:03:28,100
I don't know.

2112
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,702
I mean, my divorce isn't even

2113
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:33,906
finalized.

2114
01:03:33,906 --> 01:03:35,775
Okay, well,

2115
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,710
take as long as you need.

2116
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,979
Thank you.

2117
01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:41,447
You know the first day

2118
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:42,448
you walked in my office,

2119
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:44,517
I wanted you.

2120
01:03:44,517 --> 01:03:47,186
August! I was married!

2121
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:50,589
And I totally respected that.

2122
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:51,891
But now you're single.

2123
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:53,225
And still so, so fine.

2124
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:55,060
I mean, you can't blame me for

2125
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,929
being the first guy putting my

2126
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:57,596
bid in.

2127
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:59,131
I don't know what to say,

2128
01:03:59,131 --> 01:03:59,832
though.

2129
01:03:59,832 --> 01:04:03,502
Don't say nothing.

2130
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:04,870
Tell you what.

2131
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:05,838
Let's just take it one day

2132
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:07,139
at a time, can we do that?

2133
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:08,641
Yes. Please,

2134
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:09,775
let's do one day at a time.

2135
01:04:09,775 --> 01:04:10,810
One day at a time?

2136
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,012
Yeah, that's good.

2137
01:04:13,012 --> 01:04:16,182
Let me ask you a question.

2138
01:04:16,182 --> 01:04:19,752
Do you still love Omar?

2139
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:22,254
I do. I do.

2140
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:24,557
That's good.

2141
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:25,591
Because that tells me

2142
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:27,193
you're a good woman.

2143
01:04:27,193 --> 01:04:29,028
But, one thing for sure,

2144
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:30,162
two things for certain,

2145
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,731
you spend enough time with me?

2146
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:33,966
I'm gonna break the wall in.

2147
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:35,067
Oh, are you? [ Laughs ]

2148
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:38,838
I am. I am!

2149
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:39,905
Okay, well, can you help me

2150
01:04:39,905 --> 01:04:41,106
break with these boxes for now?

2151
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:41,907
I can do that.

2152
01:04:41,907 --> 01:04:42,208
Oh.

2153
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,008
I can do that.

2154
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:46,111
Thank you.

[ Dog barking ]

2156
01:05:21,847 --> 01:05:23,816
Noelle! What are you doing?!

2157
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,085
No. No, no, no.

2158
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:29,788
This can't be true.

2159
01:05:29,788 --> 01:05:32,291
Oh, gosh.

2160
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,626
Oh, I can't believe this is

2161
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:34,560
happening.

[ Gasps ]

2163
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:38,864
I wasn't gonna

2164
01:05:38,864 --> 01:05:39,698
let him kill me.

2165
01:05:39,698 --> 01:05:41,634
I was just gonna let him bite me

2166
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:42,067
a few times.

2167
01:05:42,067 --> 01:05:43,235
Girl, what?

2168
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,337
What am I gonna do with you?

2169
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,573
I thought that maybe if I got

2170
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,575
hurt, then you and Ms. Wright

2171
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:52,211
would work out your marriage.

2172
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:53,846
Oh, sweetheart. No.

2173
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:55,114
No, no, no, no.

2174
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:56,715
Listen, don't worry about me

2175

and Mrs. Wright.

2176
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,984
I mean, I appreciate it, but

2177
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:00,653
we'll -- we'll -- we'll work it

2178
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:01,353
out, okay?

2179
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:02,655
Okay.

2180
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:03,656
You're too smart and pretty

2181
01:06:03,656 --> 01:06:06,258
to be doing stuff like that.

2182
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:07,326
Okay, here comes my dad.

2183
01:06:07,326 --> 01:06:08,594
Are you gonna tell him?

2184
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:09,828
No, but you pull a stupid

2185
01:06:09,828 --> 01:06:11,597
stunt like that again, I will.

2186
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:13,732
I think divorce is stupid.

2187
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:14,733
Okay, now I'm gonna tell him.

2188

Okay, okay!

01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:50,602
My plan was never to have a baby

2388
01:11:50,602 --> 01:11:51,403
by myself.

2389
01:11:51,403 --> 01:11:52,504
No, no, no, no.

2390
01:11:52,504 --> 01:11:54,106
You know we don't believe

2391
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,240
in abortions, okay?

2392
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,409
We got your back. All right?

2393
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:59,111
I mean...you can give

2394
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,346
the baby my last name.

2395
01:12:01,346 --> 01:12:02,547
You guys have been trying

2396
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:04,716
to have a child for a long time.

2397
01:12:04,716 --> 01:12:06,318
Yep.

2398
01:12:06,318 --> 01:12:08,253
This -- Oh, I can't believe

2399
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:09,254
this happened.

2400
01:12:09,254 --> 01:12:12,691
This baby is a blessing.

2401
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:13,959
I'ma be an auntie.

2402
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:14,593
At the end of the day,

2403
01:12:14,593 --> 01:12:16,161
I'll be an auntie.

2404
01:12:16,161 --> 01:12:17,396
And we got to celebrate that.

2405
01:12:17,396 --> 01:12:17,996
It -- girl,

2406
01:12:17,996 --> 01:12:19,197
where you put the glasses at?

2407
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:20,065
Is the vodka in there?

2408
01:12:20,065 --> 01:12:22,534
Well, you gonna have some milk.

2409
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,411
It's okay, baby.

2410
01:12:32,411 --> 01:12:35,013
[ Laughs ]

2411
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:37,015
Yeah, so this is, uh, my home.

2412
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:39,151
So, what do you guys think?

2413
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:39,685
It's amazing.

2414
01:12:39,685 --> 01:12:40,419
It is perfect.

2415
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:41,153
God.

2416
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:42,487
And how about that bathroom?

2417
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,056
Right. And the closet? Oh!

2418
01:12:44,056 --> 01:12:45,057
She loved the closets.

2419
01:12:45,057 --> 01:12:45,724
Already on it.

2420
01:12:45,724 --> 01:12:47,059
Love it. I love to hear that.

2421
01:12:47,059 --> 01:12:47,726
I loved the patio, too.

2422
01:12:47,726 --> 01:12:49,394
It's perfect.

2423
01:12:49,394 --> 01:12:50,329
I'm not sure if you guys have

2424
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,296
any kids, but we have a great

2425
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:53,365
school system, so, I mean...

2426
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:54,299
Yeah.

2427
01:12:54,299 --> 01:12:55,267
This house is great for

2428
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:55,667
children.

2429
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:56,601
Oh, and the living room

2430
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:58,570
is gonna be the perfect size

2431
01:12:58,570 --> 01:12:59,304
for all of them.

2432
01:12:59,304 --> 01:13:01,406
Yeah, so hopefully we can do

2433
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:02,774
some business, sell the house

2434
01:13:02,774 --> 01:13:04,409
rather quickly 'cause I got some

2435
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:05,677
business in Europe, uh, so,

2436
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,112
yeah, but, uh, thank you.

2437
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:08,146
Absolutely, Omar.

2438
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:09,381
Thank you so much for the

2439
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:10,682
opportunity to check it out.

2440
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:11,783
Thank you so much.

2441
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:13,352
Mr. Wright, thanks for your

2442
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:14,286
time, I really do appreciate it.

2443
01:13:14,286 --> 01:13:15,220
Oh, this -- come off, Lis,

2444
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,188
you know you my girl.

2445
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,122
Thank you, guys.

2446
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:17,689
Have a good day, okay?

2447
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:20,359
Thank you.

2448
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:26,031
Hey, um...

2449
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:26,631
Uh, excuse me,

2450
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:27,466
what are you doing?

2451
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:29,534
Well, I just came by to --

2452
01:13:29,534 --> 01:13:30,235
Wait, wait, wait.

2453
01:13:30,235 --> 01:13:31,203
You -- I know you're not about

2454
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:32,571
to sell the house, right?

2455
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:33,372
Yeah, Samira,

2456
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:34,339
I'm about to sell the house.

2457
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:35,240
Don't act like you don't know

2458
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,609
what's going on, okay?

2459
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:38,243
Look, I'm not

2460
01:13:38,243 --> 01:13:39,077
in the mood to talk.

2461
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:41,313
I appreciate, you know, you guys

2462
01:13:41,313 --> 01:13:41,713
trying to...

2463
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,215
Okay, well, look, I just came

2464
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:44,249
over because I need to talk to

2465
01:13:44,249 --> 01:13:45,350
you about something, so...

2466
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,184
Talk to me about what?

2467
01:13:46,184 --> 01:13:47,119
You know what, forget it.

2468
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,353
No! But, I just...

2469
01:13:48,353 --> 01:13:49,388
Bye! I'm not in the mood.

2470
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:52,424
Goodbye.

2471
01:13:55,694 --> 01:13:56,828
Oh, hey.

2472
01:13:56,828 --> 01:13:58,096
Hey, Kareena.

2473
01:13:58,096 --> 01:14:00,098
Um, I called you, earlier.

2474
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:00,799
I know. I'm sorry,

2475
01:14:00,799 --> 01:14:01,633
I couldn't take your call,

2476
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:02,834
but I knew you wanted to talk to

2477
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,102
me about something. What's up?

2478
01:14:04,102 --> 01:14:04,836
Yeah, well,

2479
01:14:04,836 --> 01:14:06,705
I heard from Peter,

2480
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:09,474
and he suggested that

2481
01:14:09,474 --> 01:14:11,843
I take you to Europe as my VP.

2482
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:12,844
Are you serious?

2483
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:13,378
Yeah.

2484
01:14:13,378 --> 01:14:14,379
Are you serious?

2485
01:14:14,379 --> 01:14:15,113
Mm-hmm.

2486
01:14:15,113 --> 01:14:16,281
Oh my -- Are you serious?

2487
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:16,648
Yeah.

2488
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:17,816
Wow. Okay, first -- don't

2489
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:19,251
look at me that way -- I didn't

2490
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:20,485
have anything to do with this.

2491
01:14:20,485 --> 01:14:21,620
I'm not, no. No, I know.

2492
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,721
I swear. I promise you.

2493
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,489
No, I promise, I believe you.

2494
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:26,725
Okay, so, what did you tell

2495
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:27,426
them?

2496
01:14:27,426 --> 01:14:29,361
I told him that I would

2497
01:14:29,361 --> 01:14:30,629
c-consider it.

2498
01:14:30,629 --> 01:14:32,531
So you're consi--

2499
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:33,765
You're considering taking me

2500
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:35,801
to Europe?

2501
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:39,504
As my VP. Europe, yay.

2502
01:14:39,504 --> 01:14:40,872
Oh, my gosh, this is awesome!

2503
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:43,742
This is awesome. Thank you.

2504
01:14:43,742 --> 01:14:44,443
No, I mean.

2505
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:45,377
You will not regret this.

2506
01:14:45,377 --> 01:14:46,511
I promise you.

2507
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:48,814
You and me, together in Europe?

2508
01:14:48,814 --> 01:14:50,782
We're gonna make magic together.

2509
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,117
Yeah, take on Europe

2510
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:52,551
by storm, huh?

2511
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:53,652
Yes we will.

2512
01:14:53,652 --> 01:14:55,120
I mean, think about it!

2513
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,388
Europe has a slough

2514
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:58,557
of untouched territory.

2515
01:14:58,557 --> 01:14:59,891
And it won't take us long to

2516
01:14:59,891 --> 01:15:00,826
launch, because think about it,

2517
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:01,693
all we have to do is use the

2518
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:03,261
same formula that we use here

2519
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:04,296
over there, and then by the

2520
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:05,764
time...

2521
01:15:05,764 --> 01:15:07,132
Hey.

2522
01:15:07,132 --> 01:15:09,534
Okay, what's wrong?

2523
01:15:13,205 --> 01:15:13,738
Nothing.

2524
01:15:13,738 --> 01:15:16,875
Omar?

2525
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:19,344
Okay, does this have anything

2526
01:15:19,344 --> 01:15:20,846
to do with what happened,

2527
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:23,548
you know, the other night?

2528
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:26,751
Um...

2529
01:15:26,751 --> 01:15:31,823
Because...

2530
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:33,692
Your wife.

2531
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,827
This is about your wife.

2532
01:15:35,827 --> 01:15:39,364
Yeah, um, Kareena,

2533
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:42,567
I like you a lot.

2534
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:46,171
But I love my wife.

2535
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:49,274
And this between you and I?

2536
01:15:49,274 --> 01:15:53,445
It can't happen.

2537
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:55,280
So, unfortunately, I'm gonna

2538
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,182
have to say no to Europe, but

2539
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:58,817
I'm gonna tell Peter yes for

2540
01:15:58,817 --> 01:15:59,384
you.

2541
01:15:59,384 --> 01:16:01,353
Yeah, I think you will be great

2542
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:02,220
in Europe.

2543
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,189
No, no, Omar. I can't do it.

2544
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,657
Listen to me, listen.

2545
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:06,324
Just hear me.

2546
01:16:06,324 --> 01:16:07,392
You worked so hard --

2547
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:08,460
Just listen to me.

2548
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,230
I think you can take Europe

2549
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,599
by storm and set up your own

2550
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:15,800
brand, your -- your own name.

2551
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,469
You're that good.

2552
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:21,206
Yeah, that sounds great.

2553
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:22,807
That sounds really great.

2554
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,709
So, um, I'll --

2555

What don't you understand?

2592
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:28,807
She just did that to get

some attention.

excuse to do anything?

2601

By the way, Carmen's pregnant.

That's impossible.

Yeah.

2615

Okay, if Carmen's pregnant,

2616
01:18:15,387 --> 01:18:16,488
it's probably because she was

But, you know, I mean.

2725
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:05,250
The female's voice she heard was

2726
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:06,851
my, um, my roommate's

2727
01:22:06,851 --> 01:22:07,986
girlfriend's voice, I mean.

2728
01:22:07,986 --> 01:22:09,087
You know, I was having problems

2729
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,923
with the bills and took a

2730
01:22:11,923 --> 01:22:14,659
roommate and had too much pride

2731
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:16,060
to tell my wife.

2732
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,028
I'm really sorry to hear

2733
01:22:17,028 --> 01:22:18,930
that.

2734
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,699
Yeah, well.

2735
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:23,868
My motto now is --

2736
01:22:23,868 --> 01:22:28,039
"If you love them, tell them."

2737
01:22:28,039 --> 01:22:29,574
Because believe me when I tell

2738
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:30,775
you, a person is here today

2739
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:34,112
and they gone tomorrow.

2740
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,081
Carmen, if you love your

2741
01:22:37,081 --> 01:22:40,285
husband, tell your husband.

2742
01:22:44,989 --> 01:22:47,158
Thank you, friend.

2743
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:50,762
You're welcome.

2744
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:54,098
Now, um, that bed over back

2746

2753

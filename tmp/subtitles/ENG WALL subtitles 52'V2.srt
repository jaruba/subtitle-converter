1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,160
Mexico,
May 2014

2
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,200
Again, again!

3
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Little chick.

4
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,840
Little chick, how do you feel now your mum is dead?

5
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,440
Your parents have died.

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,480
So, how do you feel?

7
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
Eat little chick.

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,320
Wait.

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,680
Eat.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,160
I've got him.

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,680
No, no, no...you'll strangle him, David.

12
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,760
No.

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,760
No little chick.

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
I don't like getting up early.

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,320
Why?

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,480
Because from Monday to Friday I need to get up...

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,120
...to wake up these two children...

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,440
...wash them, dress them.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,080
You have no idea how difficult it is
to brush Yami's hair.

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,160
You have no idea how difficult it is
to give this boy a wash.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,040
You don't know Alejandro.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Why?

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Because you are supposedly looking for a job...

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
...to be able to feed us.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,680
Do you think it's easy to support you
for a year?

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Just me supporting all of you.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
My only worry...

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,720
...the only responsibility I give you...

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,160
...is to look after the children while I'm not here.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh sure! One responsibility!
Why do you lie Alejandro?

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Don't lie to yourself.

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm the only one who tidies
the house here!

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,760
Who has to tidy the living room?...

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
...and my bedroom.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
While you're supposedly
looking for a job,...

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,040
...at least you're able go out and get some distraction.

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
I have to stay here, shut in.

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,040
I can't wait for the day that Mum gets out,...

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,520
...because you're old enough
to leave this house.

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,400
I wish Mum was out and you left this place...

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,680
...and stopped telling me what to do.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
I love my brother with all my heart...

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,880
...but I feel a kind of hatred for him too.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I don't express my feelings very well.
I'm crazy.

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,600
But...

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,640
...I hate him because...

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,920
...I know the situation we're in but for one day...

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,600
...just one day that he rests and says...

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,240
..."for the rest of the year, I'm your father.
But today I'm your brother."

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,520
But he doesn't.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,640
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
How many is this?

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,680
It was...one, two, three; it's three.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,080
Three potatoes.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,640
Eat properly David.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,120
Well, I'm done.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
No, you didn't eat the tomato.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,480
I finished. And you haven't finished yet.

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,320
Mum said you shouldn't pee yourself anymore.

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,840
That if you did, we had to wash you.

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
With cold water.

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,200
And to David she said
to stop having tantrums in the mornings...

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,600
when I change him...

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,360
...because that's what he always does.

65
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,320
Mummy said she loves you very much.

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,120
She loves you very much
and that if you're good...

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,240
...she said that, if you're good,
she'll come and visit you.

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Do you want mummy to come?

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
To come here?

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
You want that?

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,320
Then you have to be good.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,040
Me too.

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
..si..

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,920
...c.

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,240
Charles likes music.

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Charles likes kuss.

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,400
No.

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
He likes it, huh?

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Yami! Yami!

80
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
You know I turn into a Lion
when anybody tickles me.

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Seriously.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,440
[If you are from outside of Mexico,
what document allows you to work in this country?]

83
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,280
The hardest thing?

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,440
To think that...

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
...I don't know...

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,400
...that I'll run out of possibilities...

87
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,680
...to keep fighting, to keep them all afloat.

88
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,200
That's the hardest thing for me.

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Ok, did you bring the
papers we asked for?

90
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,520
Well, they are kind of incomplete because...

91
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,760
...I'm not from here, you see.
They're partly done.

92
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,280
Where are you from?

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm from Honduras.

94
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,920
Ok. So your papers aren't sorted
for you to work here?

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,720
No, they haven't been processed yet.

96
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,040
The thing is that I'm from Honduras and...

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,120
...that's why I can't get a job here but I need it.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,560
I need to work.

99
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,000
But...why don't you get your papers first?

100
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Didn't he move?

101
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,200
Yes.

102
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,120
He's always moving.

103
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,200
Did you feel pain today?

104
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
No, not now.

105
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Only when he moves a lot,
but no. No pain today.

106
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,080
A kick?

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,560
He won't move, if you're touching him.

108
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,520
Too bad, when he wants me to carry him I won't.

109
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Hello

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
Hi son.

111
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
How are you Mum?

112
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Ok son, good evening.

113
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
How have you been?

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
Good honey, and you?

115
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Good, thank God.

116
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
And the kids?

117
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
They're there playing.

118
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,520
David...

119
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,200
And Rocio?

120
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,720
What?

121
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,560
Rocio was watching TV downstairs I think.

122
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Ahh.

123
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,760
On Tuesday?

124
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,520
What?

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,120
Everything ok?

126
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,640
Yes, thank God, yes.

127
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
And...on Tuesday, right?

128
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,320
On Tuesday, they'll say something, right?

129
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Yes son.

130
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
We have to wait.

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,040
Be strong, don't fall apart.

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,320
You have to keep going.

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,680
You know I love you and I'm very grateful.

134
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, don't worry about that.

135
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Sometimes Rocio drives me crazy
but we're getting by.

136
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,000
You know she's a teenager.
She's at that age.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know.

138
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
The phone card is running out. I'll call you tomorrow.

139
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,360
Ok.

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,160
Be good honey. Good night.

141
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,720
Do you need anything there?

142
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,920
No honey.

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
Paper or something?

144
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,120
No son. The girls gave me some food and biscuits.

145
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Ok.

146
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,000
Ok son, good night.

147
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
What scares me?

148
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,080
What scares me is...

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,120
...the idea that my mum gets
an extremely long sentence...

150
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,400
...and she can't get out again...

151
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,360
...or she dies of sadness in there.

152
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,320
Hello?

153
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,360
Hi Mummy!

154
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm ok.

155
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
Here they are!

156
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,600
She's asking for her good looking son.

157
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
But Ale isn't here.

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
He's not here.

159
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,360
It's a joke! Here he is.

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,680
Take it David.

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
Hello Mummy.

162
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,280
Jumping, jumping, pum, pum.

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,640
What is it? Do you think that's funny?

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,880
Do you think that's funny?

165
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,280
Yes, it's funny!

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,800
It's not funny!

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,400
Yes it's funny!

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,680
It's not.

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Yes it's funny!

170
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,840
It's not.

171
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,760
It's not funny! It's very funny!

172
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
It's a joke, it's not.

173
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,600
It's not funny or very funny.

174
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,320
It's super funny!

175
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,640
It's mum.This time it's for real. Wait outside.

176
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,080
Hello?

177
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,280
Hi Mummy!

178
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,320
Hi sweetie! How are you honey?

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,120
Good.

180
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,720
They gave you the news, right?

181
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,480
What news?

182
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
They sentenced me.

183
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
No Mummy...how long?

184
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Ten years honey.

185
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,640
No Mummy...don't say that.

186
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,760
Yes sweetie, there's nothing I can do.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,480
Justice isn't for everybody.

188
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,360
Maybe because we're immigrants;
I have to pay for it.

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,320
But the true criminals are outside.

190
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,440
Don't tell me it's ten years.

191
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Ten years darling,
it's unfair but what can we do?

192
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,280
No.

193
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,440
Do you know what's the important thing here?

194
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,040
That you know I never did anything wrong.

195
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,320
I feel proud about that and
I want you to feel proud too.

196
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,800
I want you to look forward...

197
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,800
...and no one will destroy you
pshycologicaly or morally.

198
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
You have the ability.

199
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,520
You and Alejandro are the older ones, and
you have the ability.

200
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Mummy...

201
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,760
Yes?

202
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,320
...thank you.

203
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Why honey?

204
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,320
For everything you gave us.

205
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,920
No honey, it's my duty.

206
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,760
It's my duty to care for you...

207
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,920
...but now the cirmcustances are keeping us apart.

208
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,240
We won't get the time back...

209
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,520
...but I'll come out stronger from here
to give you the things you need.

210
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,920
I promise I'll make up for the time.

211
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
I promise.

212
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
With God's will we'll make it; you'll see.

213
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,320
I swear.

214
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,760
Remember when I used to
ring you in Honduras...

215
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,600
...and told you I was going to bring you here?

216
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,400
I kept my promise.

217
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,920
This time too I was going to keep my promise...

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
...because I was about to leave this place...

219
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
...because all the evidence
was in my favour.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But in the end, the law didn't see it that way.

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,120
But...

222
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
...if we have faith...

223
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,640
...everything will be ok; you'll see.

224
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,080
Yes.

225
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,440
I love you honey.

226
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,240
Yes.

227
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,120
I thought you weren't going to bring me.

228
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Do you want me to tell the driver to stop
and let you get out?

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,200
Huh?

230
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,360
I take responsibilities to make your life easier.

231
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,880
I have to take the role of the father here.

232
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,720
You overdo it.

233
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,480
I have to work. If I don't we won't have food the next day.

234
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
They donate  food to the house Alejandro.

235
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,720
I know Rocio, but we can't live off beans all our lives.

236
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,440
You see? Now you get it!

237
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,360
I've been telling you for months...

238
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,320
...that beans and rice isn't the best food.

239
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,280
And now?

240
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
This is what we'll do.

241
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,480
We won't tell mum about this...

242
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,280
...because if we tell her she'll worry.

243
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I don't want her to get ill...

244
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,880
...especially in there.

245
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,200
I love you a lot.

246
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,760
I love you very very much.

247
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
You can't imagine it.

248
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,000
I love you too.

249
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,840
I want you to promise me...

250
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,120
...that we're going to make this family work
till the day Mum gets out.

251
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
I hope that'll be soon.

252
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,240
I want her to find a united family.

253
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
Can you promise me that?

254
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,720
Are we going to help each other?

255
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
Give me a hug.

256
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,600
Are you sure they'll let this in?

257
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,400
Yeah, maybe.

258
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,440
One year and four months later

259
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,080
If we go at 120km per hour...

260
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,560
My mum has now been in jail
for two years and four months.

261
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,120
Since she was put in jail...

262
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,600
...I haven't been doing very well
in my relationship with myself.

263
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,600
Sometimes I think,
why am I always answering back to my brother?

264
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,680
But sometimes I say to myself,
it's not my fault!

265
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,840
It's obvious. I'm at an age where I think
I'm the queen of the world...

266
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,640
...but I'm not.

267
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,520
I don't know how to explain how I feel...

268
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,680
I'm confused.

269
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Austin...

270
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
Look...

271
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you want a sweet?

272
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,760
Children...

273
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,040
...you're going to see the surprise I prepared.

274
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,440
Come in.

275
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
I haven't opened the door yet.

276
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,160
Wow...is this the new house?

277
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Yes.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,320
What do you think?

279
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,240
This is yours and your brother's bedroom.

280
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,760
This is my bedroom.

281
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,680
This is the kitchen.

282
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,880
This is the living room.
Did you see the huge TV we've got?

283
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,440
Carolina...

284
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
...did you see the huge TV?

285
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,640
Wow.

286
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Do you like it?

287
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,080
Yes.

288
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Look!

289
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,120
An email from your dad.

290
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,840
It says...

291
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,280
Hello children, how are you?
I love you very much and...

292
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,840
...I'll be there on Saturday.
I'm in New York at the minute.

293
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,600
See you on Saturday.
I love you. Kisses.

294
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,640
I'm going to take you on holidays very soon, ok?

295
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,160
We love you very much.

296
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,000
We love you very much daddy.

297
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,520
You're the best dad.

298
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,520
You're the best, dad.

299
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,560
And we always miss you in New York.

300
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,880
Ok.

301
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm hungry.

302
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,520
Me too.

303
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Me too.

304
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,240
What if we have...

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,240
...hot cakes?...

306
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,640
...fried chicken?

307
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Hot cakes.

308
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,680
or...

309
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,000
...pizza!

310
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,680
Rocio!

311
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
Eyoo!

312
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,160
Bring something to wash the vegetables...

313
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,440
...and bring the chopping board to help me here.

314
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,880
Ok.

315
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Anyway, this is Alejandro's. So you know.

316
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm leaving.

317
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,000
Eat!

318
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,600
But there's a fly in my soup.

319
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,280
What do you mean,
"there's a fly"?

320
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,200
Look!

321
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
We're sorry lady.

322
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,680
Due to this incident her food will be free.

323
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,040
Ale! Your food.

324
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,800
Thank you.

325
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,680
You're welcome.

326
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Hello?

327
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Hi honey, how are you?

328
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
Good Mummy, thanks to God.

329
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,280
And the children?

330
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,360
They're playing there.

331
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,000
Ok. Put me through to Rocio, but let me
tell you something first.

332
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
They re-opened my case.

333
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,480
They're processing it.

334
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,480
But is that good or bad news?

335
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,680
I think it's good news. We'll see.

336
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,640
Let's ask God to help.

337
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,240
I could get released or...

338
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,280
...I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.

339
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,640
Look at this.

340
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,200
Should we ask Ale?

341
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
No.

342
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Come on David.

343
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,320
Well, if you like this with chocolate.

344
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,640
But.

345
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,160
No David.

346
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
This one.

347
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,360
Both.

348
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,200
David says he wants this, and I want that.

349
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,000
One each.

350
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Or we take two each.

351
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,800
Two for you and two for David.

352
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,680
Huh?

353
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,240
One is enough.

354
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,240
But just in case?

355
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,760
No.

356
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,400
No.

357
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,800
I'll get you sweets.

358
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,640
But not this.
You need an oven to cook it.

359
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,160
You need an oven.

360
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,160
Or maybe you don't.

361
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,600
I can't stay here for the next ten years.

362
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,000
It's like getting stuck.

363
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,160
On one hand, hope is good;
but on the other hand, it's bad.

364
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,800
If I have hope that my mum
will be released,

365
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,280
I'll cling to that idea
and won't be able to move forward.

366
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,640
No.

367
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
The second option is to go to the United States.

368
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Olga, my mum, and I
have already talked about it.

369
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
It's a bit drastic because...

370
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,760
...it means we would separate completely.

371
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,720
The children would go to Honduras with an aunty.

372
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,560
Olga and Austin to Palenque.

373
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,000
My sister Rocio would stay here with a friend.

374
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,680
I think a lot about the children though...

375
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,240
...because they can't understand why.

376
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,640
You can't explain to them what you have to do.

377
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,040
So...

378
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,600
...if we take this option and
the family has to split up...

379
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,920
...the children will ask me, "why?"

380
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,400
And I won't be able to tell them
why I'm taking them away from their mum.

381
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,480
I won't be able to reply.

382
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
Do you need help?

383
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,800
Yes.

384
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,920
Have you already taken your trousers off?

385
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,000
Yes.

386
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,120
Now.

387
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,400
Where are my clothes?

388
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,680
There's no time for you to have a wash.

389
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,200
Are you almost done?

390
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,280
Hurry up! It's getting late.

391
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,760
God! David! You're like a baby.

392
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Honestly! For God's sake.

393
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
You can't eat.

394
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,800
Thanks Rocio!

395
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
You're welcome.

396
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,080
Go and clean your cup.

397
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,160
Who yelled at you?

398
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Nodody.

399
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,000
Why are you crying then?

400
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
For nothing.

401
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,720
And why are you crying?
Nobody cries for nothing

402
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,000
Because you didn't listen to me.

403
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,840
Why?

404
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,240
Because you didn't listen to me.

405
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
Ok, but why didn't I listen to you?

406
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,320
I don't know!

407
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Look, my motorbike!
My motorbike!

408
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,640
I'm braking.

409
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,640
My motorbike at high speed...

410
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
...at high speed like this.

411
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
Hello honey, how are you?

412
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm ok.

413
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,640
Ok?

414
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,720
And Alejandro?

415
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,160
He's working. He hasn't arrived yet.

416
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,600
He hasn't arrived?

417
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,680
And how are you all?

418
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
So so, but ok.

419
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,920
And what about that boyfriend of yours?

420
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,920
He's not my boyfriend.
He's just a friend, Mummy.

421
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,720
Be very careful.
Don't let that desperation to be with boys...

422
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,040
...make you do something you'll regret.

423
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,920
No Mummy, don't worry.

424
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
You're still too young honey.

425
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,560
I know. You've always told me.

426
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Well, I reckon,
you're a very intelligent young woman.

427
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,640
Don't let me down.

428
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,880
Listen I want you to write down the things...

429
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,040
...you need to bring when you come over,
for the pies.

430
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,200
Ok, just a minute. I just need to finish this...

431
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,280
...just a minute.

432
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,160
I don't like it when someone says,
I like you because you're pretty.

433
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,040
I like you because you're hot.

434
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,840
And not because of how I behave, how I am.

435
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,720
I wouldn't like to have the kind of boyfriend that
loves you one minute...

436
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
...and hits you the next.

437
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,200
I want someone who's honest with me.

438
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,520
So...

439
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,280
...if that person exists...

440
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,400
...that would be my Prince Charming.

441
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,640
And I'd be willing to have a family with him.

442
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,800
Ale.

443
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey, will you give me permission
to go to the cinema with some friends?

444
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,320
No.

445
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
Why not?

446
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,480
Because I was talking to Mum
and she said some things...

447
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
...that don't make sense.

448
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,280
What things?

449
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Who is that boy you told Mum about?

450
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,200
But why do we need to talk about that?
Are you going to give me permission?

451
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,240
So?

452
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,560
So what?

453
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Who are you going to the cinema with?

454
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm telling you.With my friends.

455
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,880
Why don't you believe in me?

456
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I've been here
two and a quarter years...

457
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,280
...putting up with you all
since Mummy's been in jail.

458
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,160
And I go and tell her, "Mum, do you know what?
Rocio got pregnant."

459
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,680
Who do you think I have to give explanations to?

460
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,160
To Mummy Alejandro but,
I'm not gonna let myself be fooled.

461
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,400
I've told you a thousand times!

462
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,120
You won't let yourself be fooled?
So you have a boyfriend.

463
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,760
No Alejandro.

464
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,480
No Rocio,
you don't have permission to go anywhere.

465
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
When was this opened?

466
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,480
Today.

467
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,360
Look Ro,...

468
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,280
...if you're all here with me, it's simply because
I don't want to throw in the towel.

469
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,920
Sometimes I want to leave everything behind,
leave you all behind.

470
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,880
But, I start thinking.

471
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,680
Mum says, "think about it, think about it".

472
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,320
Yes, but I need a little bit of space.

473
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,240
I want a fuck load of space too!

474
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,520
You can't imagine how much
I'd like to have time to study now.

475
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,240
To get a degree, be able to earn more money,
so I can fix my fucking papers here.

476
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,640
We want a lot of things,
but we can't have them all like that!

477
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,240
But I also want a little bit of space...

478
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,680
...so I can get out a bit...

479
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,920
...because I've told you a thousand times...

480
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
...I get bored here.

481
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Or we go out together, not just by myself!

482
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,120
Even if we don't spend one single cent,
just to get out at least.

483
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,640
Go to the park or something.

484
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,040
Haven't you stopped for a second
to think about Mum?

485
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Don't you think Mummy suffocates there?

486
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,120
Eh?

487
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,040
Imagine, locked up by four walls.

488
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,600
I need that...

489
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,280
I need to know...

490
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,120
...if you'll be there unconditionally
to help me.

491
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Yes Ale.

492
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
Because imagine...

493
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,760
...it's more than two years that
Mum has been there.

494
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,520
And who knows how many more years
she'll be there for.

495
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,120
If things carry on the way they are now,
we'll go from bad to worse.

496
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
So I need you to assure me and tell me,...

497
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,280
"...Ale, I can help you".

498
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Yes, you can count on me
and I'll support you.

499
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,680
She says this is a test we have to pass...

500
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,560
...a small obstacle to overcome.

501
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
And...

502
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
...I just hope...

503
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,920
...she will come out soon because...

504
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,120
...I can't continue living like this...

505
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,120
...fighting and fighting with my brothers,
my sister in law, my brother...

506
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,560
...punishments...

507
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,000
...and restrictions.

508
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,160
[How to cross the border through Tijuana ]

509
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,880
Hi.

510
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,400
Hello son, how are you?

511
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,600
Bad.

512
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,440
Why bad honey?

513
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,240
Because I don't know what to do.

514
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,360
Look honey...think about it first.

515
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Look, the children will be split up.
You'll be separated from them.

516
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,560
Nobody is going to look after them like you do.

517
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,840
Give me another couple of months.

518
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,600
Let's keep the hope that I can be released.

519
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
I don't know...

520
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
...we'll see how things go.

521
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,280
But if this situation doesn't change,...

522
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,200
...I can't stay here.

523
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,400
Without papers everything is fucked.

524
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,280
The money I make isn't enough.

525
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,360
Who's going to take you across?

526
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,440
I don't know. I'd look for a coyote.

527
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
Look honey, think about the pros and cons.

528
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
It's risky!

529
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,880
It was so difficult for me
to come here from Honduras.

530
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,200
Just imagine from here to the United States!

531
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,560
But here Mummy, without papers,
nobody gives me a good job.

532
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
A good salary more than anything.
That's most important.

533
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,320
I know. I know sweety.

534
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,840
But just give me two more months.

535
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,200
If after two months you see
we haven't solved anything...

536
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,880
...let's wait and see what the judge's decision is.

537
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,360
Maybe I'm lucky and I'm let out.

538
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,560
Don't fall apart son, not now!

539
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,200
You've put up with it for more than two years.

540
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Can't you put up with it a bit longer?

541
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,360
Don't be upset! Don't be upset.

542
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,520
Put into practice what I've always told you.

543
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,640
Be optimistic.

544
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,560
And lift up that self-esteem that
you've always had so much of.

545
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,720
Better times will come, son.
Don't fall apart.

546
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Well Mum, I'm going home now
because I just finished work.

547
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm a bit tired and hungry.

548
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,920
I'll call you later then, or tomorrow;
because I don't have a phone card.

549
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,880
Ok.

550
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,480
Well son I love you very much, alright?

551
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
I love you too.

552
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,720
I love you honey.

553
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,080
You think, why is this happening to me?

554
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,440
You see the people around you and think...

555
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,480
...why me?...

556
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,200
...with so many people in the world.

557
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,160
There are people more miserable than me.

558
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,160
They're in worse situations.

559
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,520
And you feel pity.

560
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,920
You feel sometimes...I don't know.

561
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,040
More than pity,
you feel sorry for those people;...

562
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,320
...because you know what it's like.

563
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,160
And people who've never gone through
such serious problems...

564
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,600
...sometimes they underestimate
what they've got.

565
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,720
You look pretty.

566
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,440
...you're like a happy teddy bear.

567
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Here is your coconut milkshake.

568
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll give you shit milkshake...

569
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,800
It doesn't want to go in!

570
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,840
Bloody thing!

571
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,800
I don't like these plates,
they don't want to be clean!

572
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Now.

573
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Bravo!

574
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,200
Hello.

575
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,720
Why did you arrive so late?

576
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,120
I went for a walk with my friends.

577
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,560
Who did you ask for permission?

578
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,040
Noboby. I know I didn't ask for permission
but I get bored here Alejandro.

579
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,360
Is that your excuse for going out
anytime you want?

580
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,160
No, but you know I feel like
a slave here with the children.

581
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,280
Turn down the TV a bit please.

582
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,600
What am I gonna do with you Rocio?

583
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,280
I'm sorry Ale.

584
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,360
I'm sorry, that's all?

585
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,840
I'll say sorry and that's it. He'll forget everything.

586
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,880
I know where you were.

587
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,640
If I wanted I could have gone there
and dragged you back by your hair...

588
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,880
...to make you feel embarrassed...

589
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,200
...and scream at you there.

590
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,520
Would you like me to go there
and scream at you?

591
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,720
...ask you why you went out
without permission?

592
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,560
No.

593
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,800
Imagine, one of these days Mummy calls
and I don't know where you are.

594
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,200
And I say, "I don't know Mummy,
I don't know where she is"

595
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,160
"And Rocio?" I don't know. She went out
without permission.

596
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,240
"Where? Who with?"

597
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,520
"I don't know because she does her own thing."

598
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,000
Can I come in to watch TV?

599
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,040
No Rocio. Go to bed.

600
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,280
They say Mexico has one of the most
transparent judicial systems

601
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,120
It won a prize for it,

602
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,880
but...

603
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,640
I realize it won that for the Mexicans,

604
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,560
but because we're not from Mexico...

605
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,600
...we are like an old rag for them.

606
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,360
They use us, squeeze us and throw us away.

607
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,160
It's not my brother and sister's fault.

608
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
It's not our fault.

609
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,080
It's not even my Mum's fault.

610
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,840
My Mum isn't guilty for
having wanted a better life for us.

611
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,920
I can't take a situation like this.

612
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,920
Well my mum's sentence is unfair.

613
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,360
My only hope is that one day...

614
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,280
...they'll discover the truth
and she'll be released sooner,...

615
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
...only if that happens.

616
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,160
Hello?

617
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,360
Really?

618
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,920
Ay Mummy! I want to cry right now.

619
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,640
Me too!

620
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,760
But out of happiness.

621
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,920
Take care and be good.

622
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
Here they are.

623
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,240
Put them on.

624
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,400
There you go.

625
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,120
Who's that?

626
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:08,920
Yami.

627
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,120
Hello Mummy.

628
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,040
Hello honey.

629
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,080
Are you happy?

630
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,840
Yes.

631
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,240
Hello.

632
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,480
Hello darling.

633
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,760
Yes, Gaby told me a while ago.
I didn't know anything.

634
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,040
Is the cream...

635
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
...wet?

636
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,400
No.

637
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,360
You have a bit there.

638
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,560
Here.

639
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,040
There, on your hand.

640
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,160
Is that her?

641
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,720
Mummy!

642
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,840
Mummy!

643
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,760
It's over now, at last.

644
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,600
Yes.

645
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
It's over now, at last.

646
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,880
At last. It's over.

647
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,200
Wait! Wait!

648
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,560
Let's take a photo, come on!

649
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,720
Smile!
You have to smile...

650
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
...because this is a happy moment.

651
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,880
Let's go home.

652
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
What are we going to eat?

653
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,360
Rice and beans!

654
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,040
No, burgers.

655
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,480
What do you want them with?

656
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:27,280
Alejandro and Rocio's mother was accused
of extortion and involvement in organized crime.

657
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,320
After 2 years and 4 months in prison
she was released due to lack of evidence.

00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,287
Goody, goody! I've got the key! Now Mantid will like me best

169
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,189
and I'll get to sit next to him at lunch!

170
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,725
- Hey! Give me that back!

171
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,395
- You're not going anywhere, Beerain. - Huh?

172
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,131
- That's right!

173
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,133
- Lumen, what are you doing here?

174
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,104
- Don't try to turn your charms on me.

175
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,875
- Give us the key... Right now!

176
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,845
- I'd love to help... But I don't have the key!

177
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,447
- Huh?

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,451
- Won't Mantid be pleased when I hand the key to him?

179
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,454
He'll give me a big hug and he'll say, "Grasshop, you're the best!"

180
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,523
And then he'll give me a fat raise.

181
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,493
- Where's he going?

182
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,263
- Then I'll come home to my beautiful wife and kids and say,

183
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,266
"We're moving out of this nest into a bigger nest!"

184
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,268
And all the Invectids will look up to me,

185
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,938
even the ones who are taller than me! Huh?

186
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,240
That looks like Buguese and his Robo-Bug

187
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,142
on their way to battle the Spider Riders.

188
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,178
Oh well, let him waste time.

189
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,948
I've got the Oracle Key and from now on, I'm top bug around here!

190
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,785
I can't wait... When I tell him I've got the key,

191
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,822
he'll go green with envy and his antennae will curl.

192
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,091
Maybe he'll cry and then I'll go, "Nyah, nyah!"

193
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,460
- Give me that key! - What?

194
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,297
- You heard me. It's not nice to steal, you know! - Hoo hoo!

195
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh my! If it isn't Princess Sparkle

196
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,236
and her insufferably sweet spider...

197
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,072
The Spider Riders must have been desperate...

198
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,875
Why don't you go home and play with your dollies?

199
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,345
This is no place for an iddle-widdle girl like you!

200
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,415
- Kyuuu! What did you call me?

201
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,123
Arachna Power!

202
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,112
Spider Rider! Kyukyuu!

203
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:04,550
- Ho! Ho! Ha! Ha! Ha!

204
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:09,421
You are the most adorable Spider Rider I have ever seen...

205
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,225
Oh, I'm so scared! Oh, how will I defend myself

206
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,327
from her terminal cuteness?

207
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,030
- Don't say I didn't warn you! - Huh?

208
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,937
Oh! No fair.

209
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,939
That really hurt!

210
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,874
- Return the key!

211
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,044
- Hey, look! You shouldn't throw that thing around!

212
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,013
You could really hurt somebody!

213
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,548
- Return it!

214
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,918
Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it!

215
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,188
Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it! Return it!

216
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,657
- Lay off me, you evil little elf!

217
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,259
Stop that, or I'll tell on you!

218
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,295
- Return it!

219
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,064
- And now that we've destroyed the Spider Riders,

220
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,333
it's time we went to the castle

221
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,169
to check on Beerain. - Yes, Buguese.

222
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,605
- Wait!

223
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,641
- So the poor, defenceless Hunter

224
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,643
still has some strength.

225
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,112
- The key!

226
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,449
Return the key!

227
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,484
- Oh...

228
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,160
- The time has come

229
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,563
to finally say goodbye to this world,

230
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,565
Hunter Steele!

231
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,601
- Please don't!

232
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:39,345
- We got the key back! Kyuu!

233
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,647
- It's too late

234
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,350
to save your friend.

235
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,320
- I... I'll never give up!

236
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,723
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

237
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,593
- Aqune, listen... We don't have to fight each other!

238
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,728
- Huh?

239
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,231
- Quiet! All of you!

240
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,277
- Nooo!

241
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,151
The key flew away.

242
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,153
- Kyuu?

243
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,522
- Something's happening!

244
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,129
- Yes...

245
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,499
- It can't be!

246
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,742
- The Oracle Key... No!

247
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,821
- [Both]: Ah!

248
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:33,225
- What happened? Shadow?

249
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,394
- The Oracle Key from Nuuma

250
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,398
has given us a new power.

251
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,201
- He even has the ability

252
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,671
to call the new key to him! Aqune!

253
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,109
- Shadow! - Right!

254
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,224
- The mask!

255
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,259
- Yes!

256
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,110
- Oh! - Aqune! Are you OK?

257
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,614
I'm sorry, I just couldn't adjust my power!

258
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,150
- What happened?

259
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,885
- You're safe.

260
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,754
- Here, take this... - Huh?

261
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,890
- It's yours...

262
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,626
The Oracle's gift... Take it.

263
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,661
- Attack!

264
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,272
- Shadow?

265
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,808
- Yes, Hunter!

266
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,813
Let's ride! - You got it!

267
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,583
- Good luck!

268
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,886
- Hunter!

269
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,670
- Look! They've transformed!

270
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,440
- Incredible! - Amazing!

271
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,209
- How did he do that?

272
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,478
How did Hunter Steele combine the power

273
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,514
of 2 Oracle Keys?

274
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,884
- Attack! Robo-Beetle!

275
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,257
- Ready? Take him!

276
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,658
- Just try!

277
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,328
- Blue Bolt!

278
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,007
- No! It can't be!

279
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,744
Once again, Spirit Oracle has chosen

280
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:42,648
to align herself with the humans.

281
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,717
- So this amazing transformation

282
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,754
is the result of 2 Oracle Keys combining forces within you?

283
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,456
- What did it feel like, Hunter?

284
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,625
- Come on, tell us!

285
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,395
- It felt like Shadow and I were one being.

286
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,497
- I agree.

287
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,434
It was as if we had been touched by the Oracle herself.

288
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,539
- Celebrate all you want,

289
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,742
Hunter and Shadow!

290
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,413
Next time, you will both pay for this!

291
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,316
I will be back!

292
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,292
- Spider Riders,

293
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,529
I've made my decision!

294
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,032
Now that the Oracle has given me the power of 2 keys,

295
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,536
I've decided I'm going to Nuuma

296
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,605
to drive out the Invectids.

297
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,075
I know it's the right thing to do!

298
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,377
- You're right.

299
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,347
- It's going to be tough, Shadow,

300
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,849
but with Arachna Power on our side,

301
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,452
we can't lose!

302
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,430

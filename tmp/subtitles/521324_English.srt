1
00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:02,866
- [Gordon Voiceover] My mission this week,

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:03,734
The Fish and Anchor.

3
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:06,240
Owners Mike and Caron are a couple at war.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,992
- And he wouldn't let me finish!

5
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,452
- Look, you're doing it again.

6
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:10,320
- [Caron] Fuck off.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,346
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Their rows are legendary.

8
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:12,215
- Fuck off.

9
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:15,102
No, I haven't got a bloody
Oscar, I'm not being sworn at!

10
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,726
- [Gordon Voiceover] They're
driving the locals away.

11
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:17,594
- Out.

12
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,700
- What I've heard, he's a bit of a tosser.

13
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,250
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
turning marriage counsellor.

14
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,751
- You can't run around like
fucking Shrek in a frock,

15
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,007
you've got to have some form of control.

16
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:26,875
- [Gordon Voiceover] Otherwise,

17
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,206
this restaurant will self-destruct.

18
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:31,883
- Ding, ding, round fucking two.

19
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:34,837
(knives swishing)

20
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:42,390
(upbeat music)

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,888
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Lampeter, a tranquil hamlet

22
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:46,426
in West Wales's glorious countryside.

23
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:50,308
A perfect setting for a
traditional, rustic restaurant.

24
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:51,573
- I mean, it's a dream for any chef

25
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,744
to have a restaurant here.

26
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:55,816
Phenomenal pastures, amazing land.

27
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:57,987
Great support with the locals.

28
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,757
But to try and understand the fuckers,

29
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:03,341
is a completely different nightmare.

30
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:06,710
- [Instructor] Hello, and
welcome to teach yourself Welsh.

31
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,943
(speaks in foreign language)

32
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,812
- [Translator] Teach yourself Welsh.

33
00:01:09,812 --> 00:01:11,919
- [Instructor] And
remember to speak out loud.

34
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,472
(speaks foreign language)

35
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:16,368
- [Instructor] Six.

36
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,914
(speaks foreign language)

37
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:18,997
Cunter.

38
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:19,866
- Cunter.

39
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:21,629
- [Instructor] First.
(speaks foreign language)

40
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,498
Dim.

41
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,714
- Dim.
- [Instructor] No.

42
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:25,245
- I feel fucking dim.

43
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,114
(upbeat music)

44
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:27,285
- [Gordon Voiceover] In
this green and pleasant land

45
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,320
lies The Fish and Anchor.

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,692
A few years back, ex-boxer Mike Timinera

47
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,715
won 700 grand on the pools.

48
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,922
It's allowed him to swap
his fish and chip shop

49
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:40,547
for the pursuit of his culinary dream.

50
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:45,105
- I'd like to set a goal of
just achieving something.

51
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,597
Be it, like, you know,
just get one Michelin star.

52
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:50,688
You know, they put a man on
the moon with no technology.

53
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,903
If you can put a man on
the moon, a Michelin star

54
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:56,174
don't sound a very big
thing to achieve, does it?

55
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,508
- [Gordon Voiceover] Mike's
got a plan to make the step up

56
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:00,463
from the fat fryer to
cooking haute cuisine,

57
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:03,213
nicking recipes from
cookbooks used in the home,

58
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,167
including mine.

59
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,600
(whistling)

60
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,630
Gordon Ramsay's book there, Sunday Lunch.

61
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,542
Rick Stein's book,
Gordon Ramsay here again.

62
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,339
I'd like to try and recreate them

63
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:17,438
or put my own slant on a lot of them

64
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,751
Very simply turn them into something

65
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,884
really special and exciting.

66
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,517
- [Gordon Voiceover] But there's
a problem in this Italian

67
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:26,184
stallion's plan for
culinary world domination.

68
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:28,498
Mike and wife Caron, who
runs the front of house,

69
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,718
just don't see eye to eye.

70
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,875
- Try to run up a hill

71
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,216
with a ball and chain around your leg.

72
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:35,802
You know, it's holding you
back, slowing you down.

73
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:38,874
- He is very critical of
me, and I don't know why

74
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:41,454
because I do my job and
I do my job bloody well.

75
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:43,174
- You're supposed to work with me.

76
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,725
I want you to work with me.
- I am working with you,

77
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:47,264
you frigging dork.
- Yeah, but you.

78
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:48,708
- [Gordon Voiceover] Married for 22 years

79
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,218
the couple's arguments
are notorious locally.

80
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:54,212
Mike and Caron have even got
into trouble with the law

81
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,140
for rowing in public.

82
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,673
- Arsehole!

83
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,282
- We were having a row
and Caron's in my face

84
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,756
so I just pushed her out
of the way, you know.

85
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:04,804
- Yeah, so I shoved him
back and I screamed back

86
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,061
and I give you a shove as well.

87
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,734
Two-handedly.

88
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:09,603
- [Gordon Voiceover]
These two don't just row

89
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,546
with each other, they also
row with the customers.

90
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:14,464
It makes for a stinking reputation

91
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,314
and no one's coming here to eat.

92
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:18,522
Haemorrhaging a grand a week,
this eatery's heading for

93
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:21,170
the big chopping board in the sky.

94
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,300
- Oh, my god.

95
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:25,835
What is that down there?

96
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,486
That can't be it, can it?

97
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:31,564
You can't miss that one can you?

98
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:34,039
Unfortunately, the Germans did.

99
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,240
How are you buddy?

100
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,214
And this is Mike?

101
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:39,273
- Yeah.

102
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:40,817
- Mike who's in love with blue.

103
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:41,892
- Blue, yeah.
(laughs)

104
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,179
- Fuck me, you can't miss it can you?

105
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,048
- No.
(laughs)

106
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:45,679
- How are you?
- All right thanks.

107
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,674
- Good, didn't realise you were so short.

108
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,543
- Well.

109
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:49,937
- Short and powerful.
- Yeah.

110
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,575
- Hey, how are you?
- How are you?

111
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:52,558
- And this is?

112
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,041
- Caron, my wife.
- Caron, how are you?

113
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,502
- Very good.
- Nice to see you.

114
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,370
- And you.

115
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,466
- And are you in love
with blue as much as Mike?

116
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,427
- No.
- No.

117
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:00,953
- No.
- Thank fuck for that.

118
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:01,908
(laughs)

119
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,553
(upbeat music)

120
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:08,448
- Ronaldo, Zola, fuck me.

121
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,207
I didn't know sports bars
existed in the middle of Wales.

122
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:15,638
It's bright, it's ghastly
and, er, yeah, it's blue.

123
00:04:18,198 --> 00:04:19,193
- [Gordon Voiceover] And
another addition to this

124
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,930
hall of fame is me.

125
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,799
- God.

126
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:23,052
- [Gordon Voiceover] A fish
recipe from one of my cookbooks

127
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:26,456
using monkfish is on the menu board.

128
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,982
- It's quite eerie when
you see your own food

129
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,164
on somebody else's menu.

130
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:34,378
It's for the home cook at home,
not in a fucking restaurant.

131
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:36,038
- [Gordon Voiceover]
This menu's a mishmash

132
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,406
of cookbook recipes.

133
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:40,791
It's so vast, I'm dizzy reading it.

134
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,930
- And I'll start with the soup first

135
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,965
my darling, please, thank you.

136
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,611
- [Gordon Voiceover] First
off, a nod to the great

137
00:04:44,611 --> 00:04:46,024
Georgia Lockatelly.

138
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:46,893
- [Gordon] Very chunky, isn't it?

139
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,109
- [Caron] Yes.

140
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,618
Well, nice?

141
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,885
- Bloody hell, do you
interrogate all the customers?

142
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:54,754
- [Caron] I do.

143
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:55,622
- You do?

144
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:57,326
- [Caron] When, when they're
awkward ones, yes I do.

145
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:58,708
- Ah, no wonder they've fucked off.

146
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,749
- [Caron] No wonder, well, well,

147
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:02,877
don't be awkward and facetious then.

148
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,520
- That's the weirdest
looking Minestrone soup

149
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,650
I've ever seen.

150
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,948
- [Caron] He's being a twat.

151
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:09,969
- [Mike] Is he?
- [Caron] Yeah.

152
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:10,977
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Next up, let's see how

153
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,819
my fish recipe stands up.

154
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,066
- It's got black bream with
a basil and pea bonne famme.

155
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,477
I've changed that, I
still use the bonne famme

156
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,171
but I roast fillet of monkfish.

157
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,397
- Shallots are raw.

158
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:28,524
Monkfish is actually
quite nice and roasted.

159
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:30,625
- [Gordon Voiceover] Finally,
a Madhur Jaffrey tribute.

160
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,989
That well-known Welsh classic,
a chicken korma curry.

161
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:37,101
- Looks like something out
of a fucking pig's trough.

162
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,729
- We had someone in,
they'd been to Claridges

163
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,269
run by Gordon Ramsay and they
thought that they enjoyed

164
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,483
their food here a lot more than
what they enjoyed it there.

165
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,368
- What the fuck is that?

166
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:49,324
Welsh snot.

167
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,342
Fuck me, we don't need to
see the dessert, do we?

168
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:53,211
Jesus.

169
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,881
Shit.

170
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:57,950
Happy to be here.

171
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,819
- [Mike] Yeah, yeah.

172
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,925
- Just arrived, sat down,
went through the menu.

173
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,220
You've got everything
and anything on there.

174
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,314
- Part of it comes from, I see something

175
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:08,347
and I like the look of it, I
want to put it on the menu.

176
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,226
- [Gordon] But the menu
reads like a trophy shelf.

177
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:11,432
- Well, I know, it's got a--

178
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,462
- You've gone round and picked
up all these little bits of--

179
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,330
- [Mike] I know.

180
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,199
- Like a fucking magpie.

181
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,067
- [Mike] Yeah, yeah.

182
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:16,936
- Trophy, trophy, trophy.

183
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:17,864
Stick it on, stick it on, stick it on.

184
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:18,732
- Yeah.

185
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:20,310
- I was really excited
about the fucking soup.

186
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,179
When the soup arrived,

187
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,185
it was just like a mush
of fucking vegetables.

188
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:25,055
A gunk, it was shocking.

189
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,173
The monkfish, even the
shallots were, like, raw, Mike,

190
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,858
they weren't even cooked,
so it was like a raw onion,

191
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,247
and then the biggest kick in the bollocks

192
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:36,687
was the fucking curry, that was shocking.

193
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,513
Was that Lloyd Grossman sauces?

194
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:39,381
- No, no.

195
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,250
- [Caron] Uncle Ben's.

196
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,118
- No, I use a sauce.

197
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:41,987
- [Gordon] Uncle Ben's?

198
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:42,855
- [Mike] Oh, yeah.

199
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:46,123
- But that's what hurts, it
causes more damage serving that.

200
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:49,094
I like your fucking passion,
that's clearly there,

201
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,202
but you're not a chef.

202
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,071
- No.

203
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,354
- And that menu's full of your wish list.

204
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,729
- Yeah.

205
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,206
- Shite.
- Shite.

206
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,146
- [Gordon Voiceover] With no customers,

207
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:04,881
it's obvious the Fish &
Anchor's reputation is bad.

208
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,833
Time to turn detective
to see just how bad.

209
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,222
- Fish & Anchor.

210
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,834
- [Gordon Voiceover] There
are clues in cyber-space,

211
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,716
recently posted reviews.

212
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,775
- The food has to be
the best I've ever eaten

213
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,469
home or abroad.

214
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:18,338
Here's another one.

215
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,042
I've been to Rick Stein's and
I've been to Gordon Ramsay's,

216
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,257
but to find a place better than them

217
00:07:22,257 --> 00:07:24,499
on my doorstep is a dream come true.

218
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,041
Mike Burns.

219
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,790
- [Gordon Voiceover] Strange,
the reviews are good.

220
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,356
So good that there's
something fishy going on here.

221
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:34,415
- There's three reviews all
written by a guy called Mike.

222
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:36,691
He's been to Rick Stein's,
he's been to Gordon Ramsay's.

223
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:39,150
It's all a little bit too familiar.

224
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,930
To find a better place
than them on my doorstep

225
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,366
is a dream come true.

226
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,277
That little fat fucker.

227
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:50,564
- Truthfully, okay, and you
don't fucking lie to me now,

228
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:51,432
nor you.

229
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,301
- [Mike] Yeah.

230
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:53,170
- Michael Burns, yeah?

231
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,632
I don't get excited about food too often,

232
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,975
and having dined at Rick
Stein's and Gordon Ramsay's

233
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,361
I think I've found a better
restaurant in West Wales.

234
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,243
Long live the Fish & Anchor,

235
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:05,458
recommended, Mike Burns, Afghanistan.

236
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,780
- Where?!

237
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,459
- That's, I don't, that's Daniel's friend

238
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,327
done that, didn't he?

239
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,196
- Yeah.

240
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,694
- Mike, truthfully, yeah?

241
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,808
And I know the truth.

242
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:15,676
- Yeah.

243
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:20,453
- Which one of these three
did you post on there?

244
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,530
- This one.

245
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,008
- Thank you, why?

246
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,280
- Well, we just wanted to,
we, we spoke to someone

247
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,719
and they say people do these
things and time to time

248
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,113
get theirself noticed, and
that's, that's what we done.

249
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:35,678
- Can you blow torch them,
put some icing sugar on there,

250
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:38,972
fucking caramelise them or
put them in the fucking bin.

251
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:40,332
Thank you.

252
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,255
(knives shinking)

253
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,914
Professional cooking is a
much, much, much tougher job

254
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:45,792
than people like Mike think so.

255
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,936
You can't just go and nick
recipes from cookbooks

256
00:08:47,936 --> 00:08:49,564
and hey presto, I'm a chef,

257
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,547
and then write your own fucking reviews.

258
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:55,502
He's a sitting disaster waiting to happen.

259
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,076
(lighthearted acoustic guitar music)

260
00:08:58,076 --> 00:08:59,227
- [Gordon Voiceover] Tonight,
I've press-ganged some

261
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:01,165
reluctant locals into eating here.

262
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,785
I need to see how Mike handles cooking

263
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:05,093
for a full restaurant.

264
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:06,062
- With such a large menu like that,

265
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,058
it must be a nightmare, no?

266
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:08,927
- It is.

267
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,079
- [Gordon] Do customers
wait long for food?

268
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:13,070
- Not usually.

269
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,398
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Mike's confident, I'm not.

270
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:17,587
His menu's made up of
cookbook recipes designed

271
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:20,646
for home cooks to lovingly slave over.

272
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,661
But for one man to try
and cook them from scratch

273
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,639
for a restaurant is madness.

274
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,681
(energetic music)

275
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,181
The dishes are just too
complicated to be cooked quickly.

276
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:38,885
Mike's running around
like a headless chicken.

277
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:39,841
- Ah, shit!

278
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:43,038
I'm doing it the hard way, I know that.

279
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:46,343
- Fuck me, you're doing
it the hard way, uh?

280
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:47,529
What's clear right now,

281
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,074
Mike is obviously not a fucking chef.

282
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:52,086
He should be cooking
for three or four tables

283
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,289
at the same time.

284
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,679
He's not, he's only cooking for one,

285
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,245
so it's like watching my mum at home

286
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:58,553
cooking for a dinner party.

287
00:09:58,553 --> 00:09:59,817
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Two hours into service

288
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:02,170
and the food's just not getting out.

289
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,306
- We haven't ordered yet.

290
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:04,415
- No one's taken your order yet?

291
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,373
- [Both] No.

292
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,583
- [Gordon Voiceover] It's like a famine.

293
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:10,297
Customers are staving off
hunger by eating bar snacks.

294
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:11,933
With an unworkable menu,

295
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,245
the service is spiralling out of control.

296
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,214
The pressure's on this
husband and wife team,

297
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,255
and these two are going to war.

298
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:21,462
Mike's even got his own
Welsh battlecry for Caron.

299
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:22,330
- Ka, Ka!

300
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:28,584
Ha!

301
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,111
What's going on?

302
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,640
- [Caron] What do you
mean what's going on?

303
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,015
- These?

304
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,272
- [Caron] Well, what am I supposed to do,

305
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:37,787
they've been there for fucking hours.

306
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,016
- Ka!

307
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,306
These tables is booked in.

308
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:42,507
- Yeah.

309
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,931
- [Mike] It's fucking ridiculous.

310
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:47,466
- Well, who's fault is that, mine is it?

311
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:48,569
- [Gordon Voiceover]
This isn't a marriage,

312
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:49,821
it's a battlefield.

313
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:52,828
Their relationship needs
some serious fixing.

314
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:55,347
Outside, there's more trouble brewing.

315
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,819
- So it's better for them to sit there,

316
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:57,687
where they're more happier.

317
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,593
- Excuse me, we've been waiting
here since eight o'clock,

318
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,504
I'm going home, I couldn't give a shit

319
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,787
about your crappy bloody pub,

320
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,532
it's an absolute load of shite,

321
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,561
we've got a 70 year old
bloody woman with us and,

322
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:11,130
and you haven't given us a bloody shit.

323
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,520
And as for you..

324
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,089
Fuck me, does he hate Gordon Ramsey's?

325
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:19,999
- [Customer] I'm going.

326
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,972
- Well, that's your prerogative,
I did apologise for the,

327
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,000
for the meal and that.

328
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,869
- Yeah, well that's not
good enough, I'm sorry.

329
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:24,737
- [Caron] But there's
no need to bloody swear

330
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:27,080
and shout in front of everybody.

331
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,833
- [Customer] Well, I'm
sorry, you're a load of crap.

332
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,980
- Yeah, well, don't bother coming back.

333
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,917
- [Customer] I shan't, don't you worry.

334
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:34,572
- [Caron] Good.

335
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:35,951
Bastard.

336
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:37,993
- [Gordon Voiceover] I can't
believe what I'm hearing.

337
00:11:37,993 --> 00:11:39,721
There's no stopping this woman.

338
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,797
There's a misunderstanding over an order,

339
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:43,512
Caron's going off on one again.

340
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,558
- I've been up since five
o'clock this morning.

341
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:46,427
- Yeah.

342
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:47,440
- I've come here specially for this.

343
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,430
- I know you have.

344
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,185
- And I've got nothing for it.

345
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,012
- Well, who's fault is that?

346
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,383
It's not my fault.

347
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,859
You was the one that said you was leaving.

348
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:55,927
- I didn't say I were leaving, I said--

349
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,170
- You did say you was leaving.

350
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,148
- I said some parties of our
fucking thing are leaving.

351
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:01,311
- Right, now I want you to leave now

352
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:02,980
because I don't want to be sworn at,

353
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,353
I've had a titful tonight.

354
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:06,205
Now, if you want to swear at me again,

355
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:07,333
you can leave right now.

356
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,337
- There you go, that's your attitude.

357
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,801
- No, I haven't got a bloody attitude,

358
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:12,343
I'm not being sworn at!

359
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:13,285
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

360
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,153
Excuse me.

361
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,208
Out.

362
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,077
Leave it.

363
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:21,946
Out.

364
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:24,936
Out.

365
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:27,010
- [Male Customer] I've
spent four fucking hours

366
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,916
waiting, fucking--

367
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,785
- Out.

368
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:29,653
Out.

369
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,042
Out.

370
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:31,911
Right?

371
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:35,271
Now, just get in your car and go.

372
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:36,889
- Oh, dear.

373
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,068
This is a first for me.

374
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,296
I've never, ever seen a customer

375
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,573
chucked out of a restaurant
like that before.

376
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:44,788
That is fucking embarrassing,
and no wonder this place

377
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:48,121
is in serious trouble
because that was appalling.

378
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:51,383
What in the fuck have
I got myself into here?

379
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,141
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Hostilities have ceased

380
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,807
Almost half the customers
didn't get served tonight.

381
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,763
Mike and Caron have gone AWOL.

382
00:12:57,763 --> 00:12:59,792
The only sense I can get in this madhouse

383
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,635
is from a 17 year old
waitress, Anne Harrad.

384
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:03,922
- I knew he'd be like this.

385
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:04,791
- [Gordon] Why?

386
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,205
- Well, he just can't help it.

387
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:07,074
- [Gordon] No.

388
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,057
- He, he just--

389
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:08,926
- He talks a lot.

390
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,589
- He talks a lot, yeah, he
thinks he can do it but he can't.

391
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:14,773
- And all the shouting,
that's not normal is it?

392
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:15,642
- Yes.

393
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,057
- It's always a battle.

394
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,106
- My god!
- [Anne] Honest to god.

395
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,379
- [Gordon] Tell me how you're feeling?

396
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,791
- Pissed right off.

397
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,659
- [Gordon] Yep.

398
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:23,879
- I've had a titful, right?

399
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,748
- [Gordon] Yeah.

400
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:25,617
- And I couldn't give two shiny shites

401
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:27,688
if there's a 150 people out
there waiting to get served.

402
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,557
- [Gordon] Caron?

403
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,951
- I feel as sick as a dog
because I've been threatened,

404
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,563
I've been called an old tart,

405
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,313
I've been called a scrubber by customers.

406
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,781
I have never, ever, ever

407
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,816
had anybody talk to me like that before.

408
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,611
- What went wrong tonight, Mike,

409
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,978
is that you did one table at a time.

410
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:51,191
Twenty-one we cooked for and
you made it look like 201.

411
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:55,445
It's the transformation from
coming out of a cook to a chef.

412
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:57,274
And I can see where you
shot yourself in the foot,

413
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:58,919
the fucking menu.

414
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,959
If I was in here and asked
to cook this fucking menu

415
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,009
because you're on your bed upstairs ill,

416
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,159
I wouldn't even attempt to
do what you did tonight.

417
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,974
One thing, okay, tomorrow,

418
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,889
even before I start
looking at the menu, okay?

419
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,402
The two of you.

420
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,959
It's like you're having a
fucking boxing match in here.

421
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,238
It's husband and wife, right?

422
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,068
That has to stop tomorrow.

423
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:21,936
- Yeah.

424
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:26,659
- I see it all the time when
customers are frustrated.

425
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:31,348
The customer's king, Caron, you
can't fucking row with them.

426
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,927
It spreads like wildfire.

427
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,612
Fuck me, welcome to Lampeter.

428
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:39,134
This is a fucking nightmare.

429
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:41,091
Turning that place around is
gonna take me a lot longer

430
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:43,340
than fucking 12 rounds I tell you.

431
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,413
(lighthearted music)

432
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,091
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
in Lampeter, West Wales,

433
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,893
at the Fish & Anchor.

434
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:50,090
Last night's service was a disaster.

435
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,800
If things don't change, this
place is going down, period.

436
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,760
It's a reality check for
chef, owner Mike Timinera.

437
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,947
This ex-boxer's on the ropes.
(sheep bleating)

438
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,308
- It is gutting to know that you're not

439
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:05,359
Really going in the right direction.

440
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,267
I mean, we're probably one step up

441
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,339
from a truck stop in
reality, that's glorified.

442
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm still not gonna give up,
I'm still gonna keep going,

443
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,011
you know, but what my aim
to do now is to listen

444
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:25,629
what Gordon says and absorb it
all like, like a sponge if I,

445
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:30,843
as much of it as I can and
point it in the right direction,

446
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:35,844
just draw another deep breath
and come back out fighting.

447
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:39,329
- [Gordon Voiceover] Time
for a bit of tough love.

448
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:41,626
My opening shot in
helping Mike is to get rid

449
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:45,587
of his comfort blanket, those
cookbooks, including mine.

450
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,808
- Right, something that's
fucking destroying you in here,

451
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:49,676
you know that?

452
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,545
- Yeah.

453
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,874
- Something that is a big
problem in this kitchen,

454
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,874
these fucking things.

455
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:56,743
- Right.

456
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,264
- Great Recipes of The World.

457
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,653
Out.

458
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,633
Asian Cooking by Uncle Ben.

459
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,813
Sunday Lunch, not interested in that.

00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,501
Make It Easy, not interested in that.

461
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,710
Rick Stein, Mediterranean,
not interested in that.

462
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,654
Come Play With Jamie,
not interested in that.

463
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,051
And Rick Stein's French Odyssey, bang.

464
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,427
Get your coat, we're going
down to the charity shop

465
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,478
and we're gonna give
something back to Lampeter.

466
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,255
Readers Digest?

467
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,355
- I don't know where they come
from, they come from here.

468
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,519
- Oh, fucking hell, don't tell me

469
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,675
you were going to give it up.

470
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:25,909
- We've had them, I've had them for--

471
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:26,790
- Open the car door please.

472
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,419
- I've had them for 20 years.

473
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:29,762
(lighthearted music)

474
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:30,694
- [Gordon Voiceover] Everything I've seen,

475
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:33,190
points to Mike trying
to be someone he's not.

476
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,973
Mock reviews, using
other people's recipes.

477
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,633
To help him, I need to find the real Mike,

478
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:41,363
starting with his Italian heritage.

479
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,471
- [Gordon] Who's that gentleman there?

480
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,550
- [Mike] That's my grandfather.

481
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,576
- Wow, er, Italian?

482
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,925
- [Mike] Yeah.
- [Gordon] Yeah, lovely.

483
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:46,794
From where?

484
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:47,662
- [Mike] From Naples.

485
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:48,531
- And?

486
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,421
- [Mike] And that's his
parents, my great-grandparents.

487
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:51,487
- Wow!

488
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,666
Again from Naples?

489
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,542
- [Mike] Again from Naples.

490
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,822
They, they were farmers,
just worked the land,

491
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:58,841
they were poor, put in
salt in it, a poor area.

492
00:16:58,841 --> 00:16:59,877
- [Gordon] Wow, so it's quite

493
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:01,735
an Italian historic tree there.

494
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:02,603
- [Mike] Yeah.

495
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:03,524
- And that lady is?

496
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,837
- That's my grandmother.

497
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:09,071
Basically who I'd learnt to
do a lot of Italian cooking,

498
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,613
you know, basically that,
that's, that's who I am.

499
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,358
You know, we're, we're, we're proud of it.

500
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,189
(lighthearted music)

501
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,320
- [Gordon Voiceover] There's
been an Italian community

502
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,251
in West Wales for years.

503
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,293
Mike's passionate about this heritage.

504
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:22,994
I plan to channel that
passion into his cooking

505
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:25,738
by making a classic Italian dish.

506
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:30,661
My starting point, a nearby
organic vegetable farm.

507
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:31,677
- Peter, how are you?

508
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:32,868
- Very well.
- Good to see you well.

509
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,091
- Nice to see you, and you.
- Likewise.

510
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:35,156
- Hello.
- There's Mike.

511
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,024
- Hello Mike.
- How are you?

512
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:36,893
- Very well.

513
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:37,988
- Mike's from the Fish & Anchor.

514
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:41,029
- We need a good service
tonight, yeah, and we're going to

515
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,310
come up with a dish that
can get some traffic through

516
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,384
the restaurant without becoming
too concentrated and stuck.

517
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:49,133
(gentle music)

518
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:50,957
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
taking Mike back to his roots.

519
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:52,400
Here, they grow the very tomatoes

520
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,833
he tasted when he was a kid.

521
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,322
- [Gordon] So, what are they called?

522
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:58,931
- [Peter] These are called San Marzano.

523
00:17:58,931 --> 00:17:59,799
- [Gordon] San Marzano.

524
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,679
- [Peter] And they're
specifically for making sauces.

525
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,548
- Yeah.

526
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,158
When was the last time you
came picking tomatoes, Mike?

527
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:05,754
- On my grandparents farm in Italy,

528
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,495
that's the last time I picked tomatoes.

529
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,956
Really, which was how long ago?

530
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:10,955
- 30 years ago or more.

531
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,049
Oh, these are beautiful.

532
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,200
- This is like being in a candy shop, uh?

533
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,440
Absolutely phenomenal, look at it.

534
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,465
- [Mike] Yeah.
- Everywhere.

535
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,481
And the different variety--

536
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:22,184
- It's been many years since
I've tasted a tomato like that.

537
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,053
- [Gordon] Uh?

538
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:24,850
(gentle music)

539
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,893
- [Gordon Voiceover] It's
time for Mike to cook

540
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,582
from his heart and not cookbooks.

541
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:31,397
His grandmother's recipe
for spaghetti and meatballs.

542
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:32,887
- [Gordon] Explain the perfect meatball.

543
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:33,915
- Good minced meat.

544
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,563
- [Gordon] Yes, a
combination of beef and pork.

545
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:36,432
- [Mike] Thyme.
- Yeah.

546
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,059
- [Mike] Parsley.
- Yeah.

547
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,748
Proper colour.
- Garlic, chilli.

548
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,432
- [Gordon] Mm hmm.

549
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:43,544
- Parmesan cheese.

550
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,022
- Good.

551
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:45,931
Could you say it was your grandmother

552
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,601
who inspired you how to cook?

553
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:48,653
Would you say that's where it started?

554
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:49,588
- [Mike] Yes, yes.
- Yeah?

555
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,599
'Cause you're quite a
passionate little fucker

556
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,467
inside aren't you?

557
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,336
- [Mike] Yeah.

558
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:54,205
- Uh?
- Yes.

559
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55,683
(lighthearted music)

560
00:18:55,683 --> 00:18:57,505
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Mike's not a chef yet.

561
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,105
He struggles cooking
for a full restaurant.

562
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,427
These meatballs are the
first step in helping him.

563
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:07,156
- Right, the emphasis of
tonight's service is what?

564
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,455
- [Mike] Is to get the tables to--

565
00:19:08,455 --> 00:19:09,324
- Speed.

566
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,192
- [Mike] Speed.

567
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,061
- Speed, yeah.

568
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:12,362
Speed, speed, speed.

569
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:14,368
- [Gordon Voiceover] Multiple
portions can be pre-prepared

570
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,408
and served up in a matter of minutes.

571
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,277
- I don't care whether you've got

572
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:19,738
ten booked or twenty booked

573
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:21,235
I don't want customers waiting

574
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,184
for that length of time again, yeah?

575
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:24,422
(hands clap)

576
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:28,372
- Now I'm going to cook
from within myself.

577
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:33,202
Finding what's within myself
and put that on a plate.

578
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:34,195
- Do me a favour.

579
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:37,934
Rub off that shit fucking
Tikka Massala, Balti,

580
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:41,968
Korma crap fucking shit off of there, yes.

581
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,893
All off, one big swipe.

582
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:45,495
There you go, bang!

583
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,891
Korma's off, yes?

584
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,420
What's your wife's name?

585
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,289
- Caron.

586
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,968
- Ah!

587
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,351
Ah!

588
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:53,933
Can you call her Caron tonight?

589
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:54,802
- [Mike] Caron.

590
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:56,689
- Yeah, no, but can you do it
in a really affectionate way

591
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:58,127
that you fucking love her?

592
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:58,995
- Yeah.

593
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:01,291
- As this is a husband and wife team.

594
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,504
Because the minute you
two start fucking showing

595
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,985
some form of affection and
respect, everyone else follows.

596
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:08,543
Ah!

597
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:11,237
That was you grunting like a troll,

598
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:13,372
looking for your fucking spanner.

599
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:15,417
No, but, it, serious.

600
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:17,143
And I was standing there
like this thinking,

601
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:22,151
fucking hell, this guy's fucking
bonkers, what's he smoking?

602
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,491
(upbeat music)

603
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,861
- [Gordon Voiceover]
Tonight, I'm gonna show Mike

604
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:28,391
how meatballs speed up service.

605
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:30,452
This place looks like a sports bar,

606
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:35,318
so I've invited the local
rugby club, 15 strapping lads,

607
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:39,188
and they're starving hungry.

608
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:41,151
- Are you on half term?

609
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,295
(customers laugh)

610
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:44,547
- [Customer] No.

611
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,634
- [Gordon] We get that 15 out, yeah?

612
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:47,502
- [Mike] Right.

613
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,823
- That's over one third of the
dining room cooked for, okay?

614
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,961
Come on.
(claps hands)

615
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,059
- [Gordon Voiceover]
It's taken just minutes

616
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,906
to serve up the meatballs
to the rugby lads.

617
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,501
Job done.

618
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,776
- [Gordon] 15 gone, yes?

619
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:00,002
- [Mike] Yeah, right, 15 gone.

620
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:03,939
- We couldn't even get 12
starters out last night, yeah?

621
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:08,059
- Yeah, these are nice yeah,
spot on, nice and spicy.

622
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,710
Very good, I think.

623
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,088
- [Customer Mike] They look like faggots.

624
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:14,797
- They're, er, they look like faggots

625
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:16,449
but they taste like meatballs, Mike.

626
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,534
It's called cuisine man.

627
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:20,796
- [Gordon Voiceover]
The kitchen's starting

628
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,312
to come together.

629
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,610
Out front, it's a different story.

630
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,086
The restaurant's busy but where's Caron?

631
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:29,920
- Sorry.

632
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,799
Be two seconds please,
sorry buddy, thank you.

633
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,294
You're not smoking, are you?

634
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:34,162
Yes or no?

635
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,031
- Yes.

636
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:35,900
- That's disgusting.

637
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,561
Come on Caron please, now, I
need everybody's help tonight.

638
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:38,429
Come on please.

639
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,298
- Right, okay.

640
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,166
- Yeah.

641
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,134
Ridiculous, come on.

642
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,617
He's busting his arse off
there, you're outside smoking.

643
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:45,087
Take the order of six, please.

644
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:45,955
- Now?
- Now.

645
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:48,150
- Well, he told me two minutes.

646
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,043
- Er, Caron, he told you two minutes.

647
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:50,911
- Yes.

648
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:51,780
- But does that mean to
say you've got to go out

649
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,649
and smoke a cigarette?

650
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,517
- No, I didn't know.

651
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:54,386
- I thought you were
running the restaurant?

652
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,254
- I am.

653
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,347
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

654
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,137
- Dear, oh, dear.

655
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:00,218
I'm not convinced with her.

656
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,432
This, for me, is someone taking
the piss like they're just

657
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,525
going out tonight for a
fucking game of bingo.

658
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,045
She's got to attack it,
run it and observe it.

659
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:10,791
But you can't disappear every
30 seconds for a cigarette,

660
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,264
for a cigarette.

661
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,216
What about customers arriving

662
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,476
and one of the owners
outside puffing away.

663
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:20,308
What kind of message is
that sending to anybody?

664
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:22,212
- [Gordon Voiceover] Caron's
standards are sloppy,

665
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:23,682
and it's showing.

666
00:22:23,682 --> 00:22:26,046
Now there's confusion
over a table's order.

667
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,275
- One fricassee

668
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,247
One monkfish, three halibut.

669
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,154
- Two steaks.
- And two fillets.

670
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,022
- Yeah, let's count this off shall we?

671
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:33,293
- Yeah.

672
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:34,634
- Two plus three is five.
- Yeah.

673
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:35,503
- Plus six.
- Yeah.

674
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,619
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,990
- Seven.

676
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,510
You're missing a main course.

677
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:46,094
We cooked exactly what you wrote.

678
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:46,998
Can you go and ask the lady

679
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,258
what she ordered please, urgently?

680
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:50,755
- So the man on the end?

681
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:53,345
(sizzling)

682
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:54,763
- Venison.

683
00:22:54,763 --> 00:22:56,272
- Oh, come on.

684
00:22:56,272 --> 00:22:59,165
One venison in straightaway please.

685
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:00,034
Okay.

686
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:00,968
- [Mike] The last venison for--

687
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,273
- Okay, let me ask you
a question now, yeah,

688
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:04,469
without getting defensive
and running off in a strop.

689
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:05,538
- No I won't, no I won't.

690
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:07,198
- Why did you forget the
venison on the order?

691
00:23:07,198 --> 00:23:09,430
- Because two people ordered the venison

692
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,756
and then the both of them.

693
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,624
- You crossed it off?

694
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,561
- Yeah, but they, both
of them cancelled it

695
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,463
and then, and then it was a
halibut to go back on and then

696
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,721
he ordered the venison again
and I forgot to put it back on.

697
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:20,876
- Okay, yeah, you forgot to write it on.

698
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:21,745
- [Caron] Yeah.

699
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:22,614
- Tomorrow.
- [Caron] Yes.

700
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:23,798
- We're having a lesson in taking orders.

701
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:24,667
- [Caron] Yeah.

702
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:25,535
- Okay?
- [Caron] Fine.

703
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:26,404
- Don't get upset.

704
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,272
- [Caron] I'm not getting upset.

705
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,169
- We're in the shit, we look stupid.

706
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:29,177
- [Caron] No you don't,

707
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,830
because I've just told them it's my fault.

708
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,793
- No, let me, let me finish.

709
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:32,681
Let, listen, let me just finish.

710
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:33,550
- [Caron] Yeah.

711
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,168
- By the time the venison's
cooked and rested.

712
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,036
- [Caron] Yeah.

713
00:23:36,036 --> 00:23:37,149
- The existing customers around the table,

714
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,415
their fellow guests will
be on fucking dessert.

715
00:23:39,415 --> 00:23:40,283
- [Caron] But--

716
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:41,152
- We as a unit look stupid.

717
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,020
- [Caron] Yeah.

718
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,064
- Please don't tell me
any different, because--

719
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:44,381
- [Caron] I'm not telling
you any different.

720
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,557
- Don't start shouting.

721
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,811
- I'm not shouting, but you--

722
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,154
- You'll run off in a
minute and start smoking.

723
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:51,276
- No I, no I won't, but
you're always in big,

724
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:52,670
you're always willing to give--

725
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,538
- Can you just concentrate?

726
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:55,091
- To give bloody screaming--

727
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:56,122
- So it's my fault now?

728
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:57,738
- It's not, your, I've
just told you it was,

729
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:59,532
I've just told them it's my fault.

730
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:00,827
- We look stupid.

731
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:02,531
- Yes I do.

732
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:03,399
- We!

733
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,346
- But you, no you don't,
because I've just told them

734
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,429
it's my fault.

735
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:07,433
I've just told them what I've--

736
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,500
- You don't get it, do you?

737
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,427
- Yes I do!

738
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,383
- You don't get it.

739
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:13,180
- Oh, Gordon, you just love
to, that's all you've done

740
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,687
for the last two days,
you've said fuck all to him.

741
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,852
But, no, that's all it is,
is every time I come out here

742
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,147
I'm still not sure about you.

743
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,767
That's all you've said all night.

744
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:23,733
- [Gordon] Are you gonna run away now?

745
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,208
- No I'm not, I'm going
out to see my customers.

746
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,337
- [Gordon] Customers can hear you.

747
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:27,205
Customers can hear you.

748
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:30,912
- Yeah, and they can hear you as well.

749
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:33,084
- Is this what it's like?

750
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:39,079
She forgets to write a venison

751
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,110
and then shouts, and
screams, and runs off.

752
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,475
- [Mike] Yeah, well, I
have a go at her as well.

753
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,341
I have a go at you when you do that.

754
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:46,210
- I've just gone out to my--

755
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,054
- [Gordon] Please stop
shouting and close the door.

756
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:48,923
- [Mike] And then you scream at me so I--

757
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,169
- I've gone out.
- Close the door.

758
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,604
Let's stop the embarrassment further.

759
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:55,127
- No, I'll talk to Mike.

760
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:55,995
- Oh, fuck off.

761
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:56,962
- I've gone out there.

762
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,946
- [Mike] I know what you
said, I heard what you said.

763
00:24:57,946 --> 00:24:59,510
- I will fuck off.

764
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:09,281
- What I was trying to say to her,

765
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,959
is there any way she
could recommend a meatball

766
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,490
that's cooked so we
can get it out quickly?

767
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,716
- Yeah.

768
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:14,975
- Rather than cooking the venison.

769
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,223
- With having a chance to get it out?

770
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,249
- Yeah, I can't even get a
fucking word in edgeways.

771
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:21,543
At eight o'clock this evening,
I'm sweating my bollocks off

772
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:23,177
trying to get this place up to speed

773
00:25:23,177 --> 00:25:26,392
and she's outside having a cigarette.

774
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:28,922
- [Mike] Ka.

775
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,331
- Ding, ding, round fucking two.

776
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,610
- [Caron] You want him, get off

777
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,656
- [Mike] Get, shut up, get it out.

778
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:35,577
What he was--

779
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,857
- [Caron] I am not being told to fuck off.

780
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,591
- [Mike] Shut your mouth and listen to me.

781
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,326
You're doing the same,
you're not listening to me,

782
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:42,373
same as you don't listen to him.

783
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,892
- [Caron] I told him it was my fault.

784
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,817
- You're, see, you're doing
it now, you're doing it now.

785
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:47,739
You're doing it now.

786
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:48,607
- [Caron] Yeah.

787
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:49,545
- You're not letting me finish

788
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:51,443
like you wouldn't let him finish.

789
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,142
- And he wouldn't let me finish.

790
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:54,636
- Look, you're doing it again.

791
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,700
You're doing it again.

792
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,793
What he was gonna say after he finished

793
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:58,700
telling you what you'd done.

794
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,568
- [Caron] Yeah.

795
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,712
- The next thing he was going
to say is, I'll tell you what,

796
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:04,152
why don't you try and get to
sell him the last meatballs

797
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:05,730
to get it out for the night.

798
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,077
But you didn't give it
a chance, because, bang,

799
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:09,044
you was there down the throat again.

800
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,060
Now, I'd like you to get behind the bar

801
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,332
where you should be and get
Jane out from behind there

802
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:17,245
because she's not allowed
behind there, right?

803
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:18,114
Stop.

804
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:20,980
- [Caron] Don't expect me back tomorrow.

805
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,849
Fuck off.

806
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:22,765
- [Mike] Just get it done.

807
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:23,633
- [Caron] Fuck off.

808
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,956
- No, just get it done.

809
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:26,062
You can't take it Kazzie, can you?

810
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:31,275
- No, I can take it but I don't
like being told to fuck off.

811
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:34,667
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
venison finally gets served.

812
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,196
- I'm deeply concerned.

813
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,064
- [Caron] Yeah.

814
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,962
- For the shouting and screaming.

815
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:41,870
You're screwing the business,

816
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,218
and the quicker you learn
to control your temper.

817
00:26:44,218 --> 00:26:45,087
- [Caron] Yeah.

818
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,468
- The quicker you're
gonna run your business.

819
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:48,337
For the better.

820
00:26:48,337 --> 00:26:49,766
Let me finish, okay?

821
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:50,984
- Oh! But I'm not allowed
to finish anything

822
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,152
I was saying to you earlier,

823
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,471
that's what I was trying to say to you.

824
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:55,809
- [Mike] Well, let him finish
and then have your turn.

825
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:57,312
- [Gordon] Is this a
competition between you and I?

826
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:58,180
- No it's not, no.

827
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,507
- Let him finish and
then you have your turn.

828
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,830
- [Caron] I don't know
what you want me to say.

829
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,782
- There you go again.

830
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:06,392
- But I, I've gone out
there, I've apologised.

831
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,130
I can't do any more.

832
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:12,328
- You can't run around like
fucking Shrek in a frock

833
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,048
and then expect us to pick up the pieces,

834
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,039
you've got to have some
form of control, Caron.

835
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,639
You're more concerned about you

836
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,386
as opposed about committed
to the business side.

837
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:21,342
- I am not.

838
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:24,166
I am not.

839
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,214
- So you make a mistake--

840
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:27,221
- So if you want to go
along with this Mike,

841
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,436
go along with it, right.

842
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:29,305
- Look Ka.

843
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:30,174
- Oh, so you're throwing the towel in?

844
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:31,514
- I am not--
- Stop it, stop it--

845
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,556
- Throwing the towel in, Gordon.

846
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:33,425
- Talk to, talk to me.

847
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:34,293
- Winding yourself up, stop it.

848
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:35,663
- Why do you work yourself up like this?

849
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:38,983
- Because I've tried to tell
you, I've gone out there,

850
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:41,878
I've apologised, I can't
do any more out there.

851
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:43,344
- [Gordon] Let me help you.

852
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:45,030
- Help me do what?

853
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,618
- Run the dining room properly.

854
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:47,862
- [Caron] Yes you can.

855
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:50,697
- I'm just asking you not to snap.

856
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:53,128
There's twenty mistakes
going on in every restaurant

857
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:56,628
across Britain every night,
we have to control them.

858
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:58,297
Your problem is one mistake,

859
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:01,027
you lose the fucking plot, my dear.

860
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:01,896
- Yeah, but if you--

861
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,169
- Please calm down.

862
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:04,584
- [Caron] I am.

863
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:08,810
- Because then we can work at it together.

864
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,456
We've finished work, go
outside, have a nice cigarette.

865
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:14,325
- Thank you.

866
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,674
- Get some fresh air.

867
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:16,543
- Can I have a cigarette now?

868
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:17,689
- Uh?

869
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:18,794
- Thank you for your help again.

870
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:19,845
- Not at all.

871
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,478
Hey, we got through it.

872
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:25,608
- You sort of come like
the fucking Italian Job

873
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:27,909
where the bus is on the edge of the cliff

874
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:29,758
and you've sort of arrived
just at the right time.

875
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,972
I'm like that bus, ready to go over.

876
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:32,948
- Get some fresh air.

877
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:33,906
- [Mike] Okay.

878
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:35,719
- Thank you.

879
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:36,588
- Just leave me.

880
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:37,457
- Come here.

881
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:38,325
- Just leave it.

882
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,259
- Come here.

883
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,128
Don't--

884
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:40,997
- Leave it.

885
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:41,865
- Look at me, look at me now.

886
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,188
- I want to be left alone.

887
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,913
- Look at me, look at me
for 30 seconds, right.

888
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:49,893
Just bear with it, right,
it's hard, it's only one week,

889
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:52,214
right, and we're gonna get
it over and done with, right,

890
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,445
and we'll be back on the right road.

891
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:54,972
Just get it all over and done with, right.

892
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:56,093
- Don't try and be reasonable, Michael.

893
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,751
- I'm not Ka, right?

894
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,228
- Because if you spoke to me
like that, what would you have?

895
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:02,322
- I know that, right, but
I have overriding respect,

896
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,896
right, for the man here
is trying to help us

897
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,765
put the business right.

898
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,158
- Yes, I have as well.

899
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:11,415
(Gordon chuckles)
- Oh, fuck me!

900
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:14,655
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
in Lampeter, West Wales,

901
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,014
at the Fish & Anchor.

902
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,365
I've been here for two
nights of madness and mayhem

903
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,423
with the owners rowing with everyone.

904
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:21,925
They've gone for each other.

905
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,558
- And he wouldn't let me finish!

906
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:24,577
- Look, you're doing it again!

907
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:25,620
- [Gordon Voiceover] I got it in the neck.

908
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,489
- So it's my fault now?

909
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:29,331
- It's not, I just told you
it wasn't, I just told them.

910
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:31,556
- [Gordon Voiceover] They've
even thrown out customers.

911
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:34,054
- Out, just get in your car and go.

912
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:35,254
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm
hitting the streets to find out

913
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:38,744
how Mike and Caron's rows
have affected public opinion.

914
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,453
- And what's the reputation?

915
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:41,321
- Bad.

916
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,201
- I used to go there quite a
lot but, erm, I got put off

917
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:49,171
by the, erm, intense
atmosphere, put it that way.

918
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,879
- Perhaps, they're a bit
quick tempered maybe.

919
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:52,747
- [Gordon] Uh huh.

920
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:53,616
- With the customers.

921
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:56,071
- I think the, er, the landlord, um,

922
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:59,130
may not always be the
most cheerful of people.

923
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,960
- What I've heard and, heard
of him, he's a bit of a tosser.

924
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,165
- If people sort of say,
well, don't go there,

925
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:08,543
there's argy-bargies going
on, you just won't go there.

926
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,346
(upbeat music)

927
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:11,815
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
Fish & Anchor's reputation

928
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:13,270
is rock bottom.

929
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,398
Now I've heard that Mike's
got into trouble with the law

930
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,520
for rowing with locals.

931
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,556
I'm turning marriage counsellor
to make Mike and Caron

932
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:22,849
realise that their arguing must stop.

933
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:27,056
If it doesn't, I can't
save the Fish & Anchor.

934
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:29,487
- [Mike] Well, I had a
conviction for a public disorder

935
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:31,623
I mean, not much more than a row.

936
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,491
- [Gordon] Yeah.

937
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,601
- I'm not proud of the
fact that I've done it.

938
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,796
- Whether they're right, you're
right, it doesn't matter.

939
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:42,594
But what I'm trying to say
in a business point of view,

940
00:30:42,594 --> 00:30:47,519
we can't wash our dirty linen
in public, and I don't know

941
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,950
if you really understand
how bad the reputation is.

942
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,625
- The only arguments that,
that, that are witnessed is,

943
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,193
here is that it's, it's all work related,

944
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,567
you know, kitchen stuff.

945
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,436
- [Gordon] Right, yeah.

946
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:05,105
- Nothing personal whatsoever.

947
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:05,974
Absolutely nothing.

948
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:06,842
- [Gordon] Okay.

949
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:09,712
But what I'm trying to say is
that the, you don't go at it--

950
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:10,580
- But--

951
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,033
- [Gordon] You don't go
at it in a small manner.

952
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:13,525
- No, I understand what you say, it,

953
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:14,394
it affects some of the customers.

954
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:15,262
- It's the severity of it.

955
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:17,607
- I keep saying to him
there's people in the bar,

956
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:20,388
you can hear, they can hear you.

957
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:21,257
And--

958
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:22,567
- [Gordon] But Caron, you're
both as bad as one another.

959
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,436
- I know we are.

960
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,839
- And what I want to say that,
I'm just trying to say that

961
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,891
we have to turn the fucking corner.

962
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,453
Now, surely you want to?

963
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,321
- [Caron] Of course I do.

964
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,229
- And surely you want to?

965
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:33,196
And I want to change it for the best,

966
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:36,525
and you both need to work at it together

967
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,896
and I'll help you with that.

968
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,049
You, you, you love each
other deep down inside,

969
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,910
but I don't get that fucking feeling

970
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,457
so I just want it run
by a husband and wife

971
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:47,293
that are supporting each other.

972
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:48,765
Yeah?

973
00:31:48,765 --> 00:31:51,465
- I know I've got to calm down,

974
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:56,563
take a chill pill and just
don't get upset over nothing.

975
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:58,251
- We want, er, the
reputation as a restaurant

976
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,637
and for ourselves to be as
good as the food we turn out,

977
00:32:00,637 --> 00:32:02,983
you know, it's just as
important, and I think,

978
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:06,942
er, Gordon has, has made that clear.

979
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:09,078
- That went really well, I
mean, I'd like to think that

980
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:12,267
they both got the message
and I think they listened,

981
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:15,030
and I want the locals to
understand that there's more

982
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,560
to the Fish & Anchor than
just fucking arguments.

983
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,854
So that has to stop.

984
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,151
Now, I can't change the
reputation overnight,

985
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:25,510
but what I can do is change
this place and help give a new

986
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,129
identity and put it back
on the map in Lampeter.

987
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:31,910
(upbeat music)

988
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:35,464
- [Gordon Voiceover] My plan
is to draw Mike's Italian roots

989
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:39,119
and turn the Fish & Anchor
into an Italian restaurant.

990
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,055
First up, get rid of
Mike's unworkable menu,

991
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:44,939
it'll make everyone's life a lot easier.

992
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:47,277
I've also arranged some
temporary help from the local

993
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:49,722
catering college to get a
new menu up and running.

994
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:51,682
- [Gordon] Mike, Caron, can
I introduce you to somebody?

995
00:32:51,682 --> 00:32:52,550
- Yes.

996
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,474
- [Gordon] This is Kelly.
- [Caron] Yes, hello Kelly.

997
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:54,343
- Yes?
Caron.

998
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:55,707
Mike, this is Kelly.

999
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,816
- Hello.
- Hi.

1000
00:32:56,816 --> 00:33:01,042
- To make things faster
and easier for you,

1001
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,691
I want you to open up and work with Kelly.

1002
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,903
- [Gordon Voiceover] I've
designed a streamlined

1003
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,357
Italian menu specially for Mike.

1004
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:12,515
- Six starters, six
mains and three desserts.

1005
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:15,501
Except there's two of you here
tonight and we go together.

1006
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:18,603
The bass, salmon, monkfish, prawns

1007
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:23,035
and shallots with garlic
is rustic, easy fish stew.

1008
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,689
- [Gordon Voiceover] This
new menu's idiot proof.

1009
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,313
He'll be able to cook top quality,

1010
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,748
rustic dishes easily and quickly.

1011
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:32,800
(sizzling)

1012
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,691
- [Gordon] Tiger prawns in.

1013
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:39,161
A tablespoon of pesto,
and pine nuts, over,

1014
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:43,000
drain off our pasta, and look, we're away.

1015
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,471
We're not fucking running over
there, running over there.

1016
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,659
- Just one step and introduction--

1017
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,133
- [Gordon] It's here and away, boom!

1018
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,137
- [Gordon Voiceover]
These dishes will fly out

1019
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,666
of the kitchen.

1020
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:54,292
It'll make for a less pressurised service,

1021
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:57,946
and no stress will help
Mike and Caron stop rowing.

1022
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,130
- [Gordon] So it was literally two minutes

1023
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,009
to put that dish together.

1024
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:01,491
- You could do that
while they're clearing.

1025
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:03,152
- Absolutely.

1026
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:06,120
- The most important thing
from the menu is the speed

1027
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,835
with which we can put
everything together, I mean,

1028
00:34:08,835 --> 00:34:12,074
it's completely, defuels
any problems or stress

1029
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:16,545
and strains within the kitchen,
erm, of having to try and,

1030
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:19,214
you know, unlike the old menu,

1031
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,827
trying to achieve something
that's almost unachievable.

1032
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,237
- If he's not stressed in the kitchen,

1033
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:25,915
we're not gonna be arguing,
because he's not screaming

1034
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,505
and shouting and me and
I haven't got nothing to

1035
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,435
shout at him back for.

1036
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,682
(dramatic music)

1037
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:33,894
- [Gordon Voiceover] I've got
more than the menu to fix.

1038
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,282
The key to any restaurant's success

1039
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,324
is creating a welcoming atmosphere.

1040
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:41,866
Meeting Caron is like coming face to face

1041
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,386
with an uptight Welsh dragon.

1042
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:47,912
She's got to relax.

1043
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:52,013
- Sometimes when you go to the
table, your face, honestly,

1044
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:54,944
I mean, the only thing that's
missing is a wasp, you know.

1045
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:57,811
I swear to god, you're like that.

1046
00:34:57,811 --> 00:34:59,086
It's intense and it's like.

1047
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:01,715
(sniffing)

1048
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:02,770
What the fuck you gonna order?

1049
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:03,752
What the fuck you gonna order?

1050
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:04,621
Do you know?

1051
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:05,606
So I want you to relax with it.

1052
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,984
- Yeah.

1053
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:08,250
- [Gordon Voiceover] Some
brave souls have volunteered

1054
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,763
to act as guinea pig customers.

1055
00:35:10,763 --> 00:35:12,957
It'll allow me to observe
Caron and the waitresses

1056
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:15,362
closely and lend a helping hand.

1057
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,991
- Have you been with us before
or is it your first time?

1058
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:18,860
Mains?

1059
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,397
- [Female Customer] Sea bass, please.

1060
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:23,348
- [Gordon Voiceover] Waitresses
Ann Harrad and Menna shine.

1061
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:25,433
Professional, courteous.

1062
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:28,120
Caron's turn.

1063
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,889
She's like the ice
maiden, completely frozen.

1064
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,078
(lighthearted music)

1065
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:35,927
(hand bangs)

1066
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:36,796
(music scratches)

1067
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:37,867
Time for a pep talk.

1068
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,122
- When the customers come in,

1069
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,930
greet them as if you need them.

1070
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,799
- [Caron] Yes.

1071
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:42,690
- Don't kiss their arse.

1072
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,559
- [Caron] No.

1073
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,811
- But make them feel welcome.

1074
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:47,124
- [Gordon Voiceover] Take two.

1075
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:49,361
She's talking, she's listening

1076
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:50,822
But she's scary.

1077
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,623
(music scratches)

1078
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:53,492
- Smile.

1079
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:54,749
- I am smiling.

1080
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:56,487
- [Gordon Voiceover] One last try.

1081
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,791
Bingo, a smile.

1082
00:35:58,747 --> 00:35:59,626
- [Caron] How are you?

1083
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,494
- Very well, thank you.

1084
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,530
- Crab cakes are very
good, so is the mushrooms.

1085
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,319
- [Gordon Voiceover] A full
on Caron charm offensive.

1086
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:08,496
- The old man's a chef

1087
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:11,098
He's not the husband, it's the old man.

1088
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:11,966
Yes.

1089
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:15,956
- I was testing you all,
not to make you look stupid

1090
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:18,108
but to make the service friendlier

1091
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:20,875
so we're not like this,
like we're still, yeah.

1092
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,342
What do you want?

1093
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,195
Yeah, what do you want?

1094
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,064
What do you recommend?

1095
00:36:25,064 --> 00:36:26,014
You've got such a lovely smile

1096
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,740
when you're in the dining room,

1097
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,326
people want to see you in here.

1098
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:30,327
Push it.

1099
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:31,776
- Yes.

1100
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:32,644
(gentle acoustic music)

1101
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:34,300
- [Gordon Voiceover] The day
of the re-launch of the new

1102
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,630
Fish & Anchor, but before it
can be an Italian restaurant,

1103
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,014
the awful sports bar decor has to go.

1104
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:42,635
- I want to bring a breath
of fresh air in here.

1105
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:45,021
We're leaning towards
something in connection

1106
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:48,900
with your grandparents,
Italian, so it's, you know,

1107
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,111
a country fare, it's warm, it's rustic

1108
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,106
and it's, it's inviting.

1109
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:55,184
Builders are here.

1110
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:56,053
(hand claps)
Let's go.

1111
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:59,651
While she's in a good mood,
yeah, can we get it going, yeah?

1112
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,152
Just in case she turns, yeah?

1113
00:37:02,152 --> 00:37:04,390
Catch that smile, yeah,
it's like the eclipse,

1114
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,041
comes round once every four years.

1115
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,822
(upbeat music)

1116
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,097
It's a fresh start for the Fish & Anchor.

1117
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,963
This new look will help make
for a relaxed atmosphere,

1118
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:18,536
perfect for welcoming back customers.

1119
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,292
- Fucking hell.

1120
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,056
- Like a breath of fresh air.

1121
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:23,952
That's what happens when first
you go down the wrong road

1122
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,863
and you can't see it, can't
see the wood for the trees.

1123
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:27,732
- [Gordon Voiceover] And finally,

1124
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,912
Mike's free of his unworkable menu.

1125
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:32,426
- Just by getting rid of
what was on that wall,

1126
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:35,045
that board and removing that from my life

1127
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:39,542
has been like lifting the
world off my shoulders.

1128
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,178
- [Gordon Voiceover] Time to
unveil the new look to the

1129
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,534
waitresses, Anne Harrad and Menna.

1130
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,053
- Gone, gone has the blue.

1131
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,431
Look at the carpet.

1132
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,128
- Oh, my god, it's cream.

1133
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:49,997
- [Gordon] Uh?

1134
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:51,668
- Nice and light, it's not
as dark as it used to be.

1135
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:52,835
- - [Gordon] Nice, Menna,
what do you think darling?

1136
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:55,321
- Not dingy and oh, it's fresh.

1137
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,259
- [Gordon] It's fresh and cheerful.

1138
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:58,682
(lighthearted music)

1139
00:37:58,682 --> 00:37:59,791
- [Gordon Voiceover] With
the restaurant sorted,

1140
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,169
it's time to deal with the
most crucial bit of the

1141
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:05,569
re-launch, winning the trust
of the people of Lampeter.

1142
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,259
I've arranged a ride into town to promote

1143
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:09,170
the new Fish & Anchor.

1144
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:11,972
- Right.

1145
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:14,838
Look at you.

1146
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:16,185
Building bridges.

1147
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:18,804
We're down off to Lampeter, yes.

1148
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:20,555
We're gonna get the message out there.

1149
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:24,001
I'm gonna shout from the
rooftops the style, yes?

1150
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,870
What you're doing, where it's coming from,

1151
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,436
why we're doing it and we're
gonna build some bridges.

1152
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,986
And the reputation is
gonna be changed, yes?

1153
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:36,608
Leaflets, hay bales, canapes
and get your arse in there.

1154
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,366
(upbeat music)

1155
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:39,583
Hold on tight.

1156
00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:41,725
- [Gordon Voiceover] It's
the start of the long road

1157
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:44,447
to rebuilding this place's reputation.

1158
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,307
- Get down to the Fish & Anchor,

1159
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,914
fantastic rustic Italian food.

1160
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:52,021
- [Gordon Voiceover] Mike
needs to rub shoulders with

1161
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:55,466
the locals and he's using his
meatballs to win them over.

1162
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,891
- Try one?

1163
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:58,614
Go on, they're lovely

1164
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:00,156
- [Gordon] Get down to the Fish & Anchor,

1165
00:39:00,156 --> 00:39:02,818
delicious meatballs, wonderful pastas.

1166
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:05,074
- [Gordon Voiceover] With no
Italian restaurants in Lampeter

1167
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:06,656
there's plenty to shout about.

1168
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:09,053
A classy menu and a new look,

1169
00:39:09,053 --> 00:39:11,892
and most important, a friendlier service.

1170
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,923
- I can confirm that Caron's
agreed to stop arguing.

1171
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:15,943
Yes or no?

1172
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:16,812
- Yes.

1173
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,720
- [Gordon] Caron has stopped
scaring the customers.

1174
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,839
She's turned a new leaf.

1175
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,255
She loves you all.

1176
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:26,231
If Mike and Caron start rowing tonight,

1177
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,304
they'll undo all the hard work.

1178
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:29,581
So I've got a plan.

1179
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:32,406
If they get stressed, rather
than tearing strips off

1180
00:39:32,406 --> 00:39:34,904
each other I'm introducing
an anger management prop.

1181
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,132
- Right, services are
quite stressful, yes?

1182
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,000
- Yeah.

1183
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,896
- Tonight, if we get 'strated,

1184
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:41,612
you and you are on the naughty step.

1185
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,481
Bang.

1186
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,596
Over there.

1187
00:39:43,596 --> 00:39:44,464
(upbeat music)

1188
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:45,385
(laughs)

1189
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:46,949
There, off you go.

1190
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:54,111
Get in there big boy, come on,

1191
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:56,230
get some welly behind it, Caron.

1192
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,898
Careful you don't get knocked out.

1193
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,451
One big one, good girl.

1194
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,532
Well done, well done, well done.

1195
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,836
Ohh! Well done.

1196
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:06,866
So, just take it out on that, yes?

1197
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:07,977
And you want to scream

1198
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,939
and you want to fuck off
outside for a cigarette.

1199
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:10,807
- [Caron] Yeah.

1200
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:12,750
- [Gordon] Yes? Take it out on that.

1201
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,366
Okay, how are we feeling?

1202
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:15,237
- Excited.
(laughs)

1203
00:40:15,237 --> 00:40:16,642
- Yes? Excited?

1204
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:17,701
How are you feeling?

1205
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:18,863
- Calm.
- [Gordon] Calm.

1206
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,206
- Collected.
- [Gordon] Yeah?

1207
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:21,262
- And excited.

1208
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:22,284
- Okay, good.

1209
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:25,848
Right in front of your eyes on that chair

1210
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:28,241
is your chef's jacket.

1211
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:30,450
For a man that's fucking
in his late forties

1212
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,541
that's been busting his arse
off for the last 20 years,

1213
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,079
this is your chance.

1214
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,490
This is your time now.

1215
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,623
Take advantage of it and
fucking do it properly,

1216
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:39,266
more importantly enjoy it.

1217
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,560
- [Anne] You're a chef Mike.

1218
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,167
- [Gordon] Now you're
gonna cook like a chef

1219
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,716
and you're gonna look like a chef.

1220
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:45,926
- [Gordon Voiceover] The reckoning,

1221
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,971
the new launch of the new Fish & Anchor.

1222
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:50,428
This is the biggest fight of Mike's life.

1223
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:53,988
For this ex-boxer, it carries
the promise of a huge reward,

1224
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:56,681
to finally call himself a chef.

1225
00:40:58,197 --> 00:40:59,389
The people of Lampeter are coming to give

1226
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:02,275
the Fish & Anchor a second chance.

1227
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:04,137
A golden opportunity for Mike and Caron

1228
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:06,522
to redeem this place's reputation.

1229
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:08,882
- Try this one, oh, the stew, it's lovely.

1230
00:41:08,882 --> 00:41:13,260
- One antipasti, two prawn
and basil, one smoked salmon.

1231
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,297
- Right, yeah, good.

1232
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:15,498
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
kitchen's feeling like

1233
00:41:15,498 --> 00:41:19,151
a professional set up with Mike
taking control like a chef.

1234
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,880
- Can you call the
girls ready for service?

1235
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,946
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
new menu's doing its job

1236
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:25,847
with dishes flying out of the
kitchen and going down well.

1237
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:29,203
- Looks quite simple,
quite plain in that respect

1238
00:41:29,203 --> 00:41:30,677
but it tastes lovely.

1239
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:32,642
Jason thinks the meatballs are brilliant.

1240
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:33,750
- [Jason] Yep.

1241
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,319
- [Gordon Voiceover] Out front
the waitresses Anne Harrad

1242
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,933
and Menna are keeping
the orders rolling in.

1243
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:43,014
Crucially, Caron's charming the guests.

1244
00:41:43,014 --> 00:41:44,145
- You're gonna be a good boy,

1245
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:47,286
you're gonna be a very good boy all night.

1246
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:48,385
Right, what can I get you?

1247
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:49,742
- [Gordon Voiceover] Just
two days ago she was shouting

1248
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:53,142
at anyone in earshot, now
she's like a new woman,

1249
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:55,662
smiling, chatting, welcoming.

1250
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:59,740
The restaurant's now at its capacity

1251
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,004
and Mike's under pressure.

1252
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:01,872
(sizzling)

1253
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:02,960
- [Anne] Got another order then.

1254
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,014
- [Mike] Right-oh!

1255
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,777
- Starters on table four cleared.

1256
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:07,068
Come on Mike, give me an answer please.

1257
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:08,154
Starters on table--

1258
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:09,103
- Starters on table four cleared?

1259
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,070
- [Gordon] They're clear, yeah.

1260
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,134
We're gonna just check now.

1261
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:12,461
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
orders are stacking up

1262
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,176
and he's panicking.

1263
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:17,362
- Whoa, whoa, you're going
too fast, listen, whoa, stop.

1264
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:19,898
- This is where it really
seriously matters now,

1265
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:22,079
I'm still unconvinced that
this guy can do more than

1266
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,533
one table at a fucking time.

1267
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,925
The menu's so idiot proof,
straightforward, easy,

1268
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:30,153
country Italian fare and
he's fucking stressing out.

1269
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:32,177
- [Gordon Voiceover] Out
front, the food isn't hitting

1270
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:33,988
the tables quickly enough.

1271
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:37,594
- We'll be, we'll be drunk
before the food comes you know.

1272
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:40,615
- I'm starving hungry,
I've been working all day

1273
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:43,389
and there's nothing happening,
this is disgraceful.

1274
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,147
- Fucking, I'm just not getting saucepans.

1275
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:46,482
Look, they're under there,

1276
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,059
and I have to use the same
saucepan over and over.

1277
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:50,440
- [Gordon Voiceover] Mike's
teetering on the edge.

1278
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,308
- Dressing.

1279
00:42:51,308 --> 00:42:52,358
Where's the dressing gone?

1280
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:54,586
- [Gordon Voiceover] This
doesn't bode well for the future.

1281
00:42:54,586 --> 00:42:55,957
- Ladle!

1282
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:58,279
Can I have some spoons, big spoons?

1283
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:01,060
- [Gordon Voiceover] I'm gutted.

1284
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:04,740
And then the night takes
an unexpected turn.

1285
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,816
- [Gordon] Shit, watch out.

1286
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,999
- [Caron] Menna!
- [Gordon] Watch out.

1287
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:07,868
Watch out.

1288
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:09,988
- [Gordon Voiceover] Waitress Menna

1289
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,516
has slipped on the floor.

1290
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:13,764
She's unconscious, it could be serious.

1291
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:17,483
An ambulance is called,
the night's service stops.

1292
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:18,610
- She doesn't want to see you like that.

1293
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,946
Right, stand up.

1294
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:21,838
I need the food taken out of the way.

1295
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:22,706
Fine.

1296
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:29,632
Er, a sad ending, erm, bad
fall, she slipped on the floor

1297
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:33,017
and, erm, hurt her back, slight seizure

1298
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:36,174
and went into some form of shock.

1299
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:37,635
Taken away in an ambulance, erm,

1300
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:40,081
thankfully her parents were
there and she stayed really calm

1301
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:42,760
and she's in safe hands.

1302
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,335
I'm convinced she's going
to be absolutely fine,

1303
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:47,452
but it was a tough night.

1304
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:48,865
(upbeat music)

1305
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:50,548
- [Gordon Voiceover]
I'm back in West Wales.

1306
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:52,555
It's a month since the Fish
& Anchor's re-opening night

1307
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:55,087
ended so abruptly when
waitress Menna slipped

1308
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:57,565
and was taken to hospital.

1309
00:43:57,565 --> 00:43:59,014
- Shit, watch out.

1310
00:43:59,014 --> 00:43:59,882
- [Gordon Voiceover] She recovered

1311
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:03,053
and went home the next day.

1312
00:44:03,053 --> 00:44:05,026
- First of all, I'm very, erm, relieved,

1313
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:07,687
the fact that Menna is back
to a hundred percent fitness.

1314
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,885
I'm dying to find out
what's actually going on

1315
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:12,200
at the Fish & Anchor,
because on the launch night,

1316
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,691
we were halfway through
and just struggling

1317
00:44:14,691 --> 00:44:16,850
to keep our neck above the waters.

1318
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,117
Has he changed back to his old ways?

1319
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:20,709
And when they've got a
problem with each other

1320
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,376
I hope they're not
washing their dirty linen

1321
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:26,127
in front of their customers.

1322
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:29,197
I don't fucking believe it.

1323
00:44:29,197 --> 00:44:31,586
He's painted the bloody thing.

1324
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,014
It looks inviting.

1325
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:35,875
That's one bit of good news.

1326
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,744
Hey.

1327
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:37,613
- [Mike] Hello.

1328
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:38,481
- How are you?
- Okay.

1329
00:44:38,481 --> 00:44:40,107
- It looks great out there.

1330
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,219
How are you, my darling?

1331
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,088
- Very good, thank you.

1332
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:42,956
- Are you well? Yes?

1333
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:43,883
- Great, yeah.

1334
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:44,752
- Menu.

1335
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,024
Dare I turn round and
look at a blackboard?

1336
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:46,893
- No.
- [Caron] No.

1337
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:47,761
- No?

1338
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:48,644
- No, written menu.

1339
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,513
- Written menu?

1340
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:53,283
Style of food is half Rick
Stein, half Garry Rhodes?

1341
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:55,460
- No, it's Italian.

1342
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,194
- Figure-wise where are we
in comparison to last year?

1343
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:02,077
- Well, er, customers, we've
double the amount of customers,

1344
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:03,306
double the amount of covers.

1345
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:04,175
- [Gordon] Yeah.

1346
00:45:04,175 --> 00:45:06,009
- And as opposed to something like a four,

1347
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,102
four and a half grand loss, we're broke,

1348
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:09,418
broke even this month.

1349
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,527
- That's good news.

1350
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,882
That's very, very, very positive.

1351
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:13,193
Rowing stopped?

1352
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:14,061
- Stopped.

1353
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:15,243
- Must have been one somewhere?

1354
00:45:15,243 --> 00:45:16,364
- There hasn't, has there?

1355
00:45:16,364 --> 00:45:17,232
- No?
- No.

1356
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:18,873
- No? Well, we've taken venison
off the menu now anyway.

1357
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:19,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1358
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:20,610
- Yeah.
(laughs)

1359
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,483
- Uh?
- Yeah.

1360
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:23,401
- I look at venison in
a completely different

1361
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,681
fucking way now, I don't
know about you, uh?

1362
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:25,631
(laughs)

1363
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,746
(lighthearted music)

1364
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:28,205
- [Gordon Voiceover] A month
ago, Mike and Caron's constant

1365
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:30,726
rows were driving the customers away.

1366
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:33,128
I can't believe they've
completely stopped.

1367
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:34,970
A quick flick through
the reservations book

1368
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,756
gives me a hotline to recent customers.

1369
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:40,959
- Now I just want some
fucking, er, background.

1370
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:42,818
- [Gordon Voiceover] Time to
find out whether Mike and Caron

1371
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:45,617
have truly built bridges with the locals.

1372
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,730
- [Gordon] Hello, is that Roger?

1373
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:47,598
- [Roger] Yeah it is.

1374
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:48,467
- [Gordon] Hi, it's Gordon
Ramsay, how are you?

1375
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:49,655
- [Roger] I'm fine, how are you?

1376
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:51,103
- [Gordon] What was the food like?

1377
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:52,918
- [Roger] It was brilliant.

1378
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:55,218
- What was the atmosphere
like in the dining room?

1379
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,456
Completely changed, lovely.

1380
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,112
- Good, and the million dollar question,

1381
00:45:58,112 --> 00:46:00,211
was there any arguing?

1382
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:01,793
- [Roger] No, none at all.

1383
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:03,504
- One nil to the Fish & Anchor.

1384
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:04,713
Sorry, is that Sue?

1385
00:46:04,713 --> 00:46:05,582
- [Sue] It is.

1386
00:46:05,582 --> 00:46:06,450
- How was dinner?

1387
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:07,524
- [Sue] It was lovely.

1388
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:09,111
- [Gordon] Was the service warm?

1389
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:10,115
- [Sue] Yes.

1390
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,247
- [Gordon] Anybody shout at you?

1391
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,196
- [Sue] No, why?
(laughs)

1392
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:14,064
- [Gordon] No.

1393
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,080
No, I'm just asking.

1394
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,948
Two nil.

1395
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:16,932
Hi, Tony, it's Gordon,

1396
00:46:16,932 --> 00:46:19,391
you sneaked into the
Fish & Anchor recently.

1397
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,741
- [Tony] Yeah, we had a nice meal there,

1398
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,165
I think there was ten of us.

1399
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:23,186
- Ten of you?

1400
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:25,344
They served ten main courses
all at the same time?

1401
00:46:25,344 --> 00:46:26,213
- [Tony] Yeah.

1402
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:27,267
- You didn't have to
take a two week holiday

1403
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,020
in-between courses?

1404
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,233
Fuck, three nil.

1405
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:32,329
There's got to be some
negativity somewhere.

1406
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,087
Did you hear any shouting, screaming?

1407
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:37,288
- [Customer] No, no, no, why,
is that usual there, is it?

1408
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,382
- Well, no, but I'm just asking you,

1409
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,528
you're the customer, you are the critic.

1410
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:43,406
Thank you my darling, big kiss.

1411
00:46:43,406 --> 00:46:47,558
For me, it tells me the
reputation is spreading,

1412
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:50,188
and it's spreading in a very positive way.

1413
00:46:50,188 --> 00:46:51,715
(upbeat music)

1414
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:53,046
The word's good.

1415
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:54,593
Seeing is believing.

1416
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:57,023
Mike's a changed man, a month
ago he was running around

1417
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,273
the kitchen like a headless chicken.

1418
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:00,769
Now he's mastered my menu,

1419
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:04,845
big boy can finally call himself a chef.

1420
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:07,937
- Ready for a bit of service
here now in a minute, girls.

1421
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:09,955
- [Gordon Voiceover] The
dishes are flying out.

1422
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:12,562
- My god, you're so quick, uh?

1423
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,961
- [Gordon Voiceover] And he's
in control of his kitchen.

1424
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:20,493
- [Mike] Where's all
these orders then, girls?

1425
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:22,574
- Did I hear right there,
you're screaming for orders?

1426
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:23,443
- [Mike] Yeah.

1427
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,569
These are going out now in a minute

1428
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:26,089
and I've got nothing to get on with.

1429
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:27,906
- [Gordon Voiceover] Out
front the atmosphere's exactly

1430
00:47:27,906 --> 00:47:31,486
what I was aiming for,
relaxed and welcoming.

1431
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:33,059
- Thank you darling, you can come again.

1432
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,109
(laughs)

1433
00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:36,845
- Now, I'm a little bit nervous.

1434
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:39,163
Yeah, well, it's going really well.

1435
00:47:39,163 --> 00:47:42,543
You know, he's got five tickets
on, yeah, there's harmony,

1436
00:47:42,543 --> 00:47:44,390
everybody's smiling,
the customers are happy.

1437
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,706
What's going on?

1438
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:46,574
- Nothing.

1439
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:47,443
- Uh?

1440
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:48,312
- Ha, ha.

1441
00:47:48,312 --> 00:47:49,180
- The--

1442
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,049
- Told you so.

1443
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:52,165
- Well, the change in him is, erm--

1444
00:47:52,165 --> 00:47:53,034
- Unbelievable.

1445
00:47:53,034 --> 00:47:54,695
He's proud of himself again.

1446
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:55,564
- [Gordon] Yeah, yeah.

1447
00:47:55,564 --> 00:47:57,840
- For getting things done and quickly

1448
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,210
and nobody's complaining and--

1449
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,401
- You look very relaxed.

1450
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,869
- I am.

1451
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:03,265
I'm enjoying myself actually.

1452
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:04,236
- Good.

1453
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:05,868
You know those cookbooks we got rid of.

1454
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:06,736
- They're gone.

1455
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:08,722
- They've gone and they
went to a good cause, yeah?

1456
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:09,592
- Went to a good cause, yeah.

1457
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:11,196
- Now I think it's about time, yeah,

1458
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:13,685
you put your own book together.

1459
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,127
(laughs)
Here we go, yeah?

1460
00:48:15,127 --> 00:48:16,854
Not too sure about your Sous Chef.

1461
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:17,785
(laughs)

1462
00:48:17,785 --> 00:48:21,518
Look at it carefully and
then start filling out

1463
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:25,485
your own rustic recipes
and cook from here.

1464
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,354
- Yeah.

1465
00:48:26,354 --> 00:48:27,222
- [Gordon] Cook from the heart.

1466
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:28,091
- [Mike] Yeah.

1467
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:30,430
- And then print it and flog it.

1468
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,478
- Put it alongside yours on
the shelves, see how we go.

1469
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:33,346
(laughs)

1470
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:34,279
- [Gordon] Take care.

1471
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:35,695
- Tah rah!

1472
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:38,564
I think me and Mike have
reassessed our marriage.

1473
00:48:38,564 --> 00:48:42,263
I really, really feel like
going on honeymoon again.

1474
00:48:42,263 --> 00:48:46,887
You know, just go, me and
him going away for a sloppy,

1475
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,371
daft weekend somewhere.

1476
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:51,546
So we might just do that soon.

1477
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:53,479
- Really happy to see it actually working,

1478
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:56,229
and for me the most important
thing is we've fixed the menu,

1479
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:58,550
that means we've fixed Mike and Caron,

1480
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,240
and if they can stick to that,

1481
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,509
they've got a happy
restaurant, happy customers

1482
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:05,637
and more importantly a happy couple.

1483
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:10,472
(upbeat music)

1484
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:11,838
I've never had a facial before.

1485
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:13,001
I had these lines at 21

1486
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:15,161
so what's the point in getting a facial.

1487
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,029
Caron, do you snore?

1488
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:16,898
- Yes.

1489
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:18,408
- You do?

1490
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:19,410
Do you bottom burp?

1491
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,921
- No, never, ever, ever do.

1492
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:24,152
(gurgling)

1493
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:26,010
- Caron, is that your tummy?

1494
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:26,879
What is that?

1495
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:27,934
- [Beautician] My gurgling plughole.

1496
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:29,732
- Okay.
(laughs)

1497
00:49:29,732 --> 00:49:32,526
(Caron snoring)
(laughs)

1498
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:33,743
- So relaxing.

1
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,714
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,653
- [Edwina] Since we don't have enough fuel

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,024
to get us to Jupiter we'll
hitch a ride on the asteroid.

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,924
Gerard, report.

5
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,526
- Generators are at full capacity.

6
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,061
Range to asteroid, 5,000.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,499
- I wasn't seriously suggesting
we attach ourselves to it.

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,000
I was joking.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,769
I was trying to lighten
our impending doom,

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,770
not embellish it.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,838
- Activate ion drives.

12
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,573
You should never try to be funny, Haskell.

13
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,409
It only gets you into trouble.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,244
- Commander 4,000.

15
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,311
- Stand by.

16
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,913
I don't want to waste
a single rad of fuel.

17
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,948
- [Haskell] I must have been
mad to have even mentioned it.

18
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,884
- [Edwina] Don't worry, we'll
find you a straitjacket.

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,352
- [Haskell] Completely mad.

20
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,286
- Come on, Haskell!

21
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,988
I've already lost one ship.

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,689
I'm not keen to repeat the experience.

23
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,525
That thing could pulverize
us in a few minutes.

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,260
Stand by to bring us alongside.

25
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,428
- Range 3,000.

26
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,563
- Well, next time I'll
keep my thoughts to myself

27
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,831
and my big mouth shut.

28
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,932
- Haskell!

29
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,367
- Impact lance armed.

30
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,836
- 2,000.
- Full forward thrust.

31
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,805
Gerard, stand by for firing.

32
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,239
- Cable doors opening.

33
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,909
(ship rattling)

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,778
- You two should be in your room.

35
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,579
What are you doing in here?

36
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,581
- It was my fault, I
had to fix Quadro first.

37
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,849
- You'll have to forget about the robot.

38
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,451
- There's no time for that,
just sit down and hang on.

39
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,120
(ominous music)

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,828
- [Edwina] Four days on the asteroid,

41
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,363
and then we slingshot
ourselves to Jupiter.

42
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,732
- We've achieved comparative
velocity with the asteroid.

43
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,202
- Distance from target?
- 400 meters.

44
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,537
- Down thrust.

45
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,239
Get us closer and do it quickly.

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,907
We're using too much fuel.

47
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:48,775
- Down thrust 1/3.

48
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,712
To think I gave up a perfectly
safe job as a designer.

49
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,948
- You did ask for this job.

50
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,849
Gerard?

51
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,649
- 300.

52
00:01:58,985 --> 00:01:59,819
250.

53
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,421
- Stand by forward lance.

54
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,255
- Standing by.

55
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,994
200.

56
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,396
- [Edwina] Wait for it, Gerard.

57
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,668
- 150.
- Fire!

58
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,338
(intense music)

59
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,079
- Yes, we're on!

60
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,481
Second lance locked in place and holding.

61
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,516
We're attached to the asteroid.

62
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,018
I'd like to see Selby
try and catch us now.

63
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,954
- You can open your eyes now, Haskell.

64
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,657
Looks like you won't need
a straitjacket after all.

65
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,592
- No I think I'll hang onto it, thanks.

66
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,197
We've still gotta get off this rock.

67
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,866
(ominous music)

68
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,944
- You know that woman has got
ice flowing through her veins.

69
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,879
- Slow down, what happened?

70
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,714
- May I remind you that your appointment

71
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,883
was for a probationary period only.

72
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,619
Sadly, your time is up.
- She sacked you?

73
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,987
- [Kumiko] She can't do that!

74
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,155
- [Michael] Didn't you
polish your buttons?

75
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,557
- [Kumiko] Michael that's not funny.

76
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,859
- Look Kumi, it's okay.
- It's not okay!

77
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,427
- Kumi, it's all right.

78
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,828
She didn't sack me.

79
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,867
She promoted me!

80
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,169
I'm now a fully qualified ensign.

81
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,003
- [Both] What?

82
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,439
- I'm on my way up the ladder,

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,741
and I need you to toe the line.

84
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,110
- Yeah right, says who?

85
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,613
- I do, and starting now.

86
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,081
All right, I want you to
get everybody together

87
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,749
for a meeting in half an hour.

88
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,753
(ship roaring)

89
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,126
All right, listen up everybody.

90
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,895
Operation Roid Ride.

91
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,998
Now because of the shortage of fuel,

92
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,801
the timing of the
slingshot could be crucial.

93
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,103
A little too early or too late,

94
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,938
we could shoot right past the colony.

95
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,343
- Great, we'll be slung
so far away from the sun

96
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,279
we'll become relics of the new ice age.

97
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,447
- I thought you'd be pleased.

98
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,649
You're the one that wanted
the cryogenic space travel.

99
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,950
(coughs)

100
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,120
- Now, the next five days are critical.

101
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,023
I want everybody to stick
to their regular routines.

102
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,826
No distractions, and no trouble.

103
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,862
That does go double for you pair.

104
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,832
- Why is it that everyone
assumes we're troublemakers?

105
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,834
- [Zac] We're just badly misunderstood.

106
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,569
- Michael, when the crucial time comes,

107
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,704
I want you to keep an
eye on this pair, okay?

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,307
- I'm not a babysitter.

109
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,341
- And we're not babies.

110
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,478
- Yeah yeah, you're just
very short intellectuals.

111
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,812
Kumi can do it.

112
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,147
- She might be needed here.

113
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,983
- Well then you do it.

114
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,786
- Listen Michael, you do it okay?

115
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,921
I'm a crew member, you're the civilian,

116
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,323
and I'm giving you the job.

117
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,461
- A couple of extra bits
of brass on his uniform

118
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,330
and he thinks he's a superhero.

119
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,765
- This is brilliant.

120
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,800
It's a copy of Selby's computer virus.

121
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,835
- Yeah well one day, Gerard's
gonna fall flat on his face

122
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,538
and I just hope that I'm there to see it.

123
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,540
- What a mind he's got.

124
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,875
- Yeah, sharp as a brick!

125
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,045
- I was talking about Selby.

126
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,380
This virus has an
exponential growth pattern.

127
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,481
Once it gets into a computer,

128
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,649
it could systematically destroy

129
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,785
an entire network in seconds.

130
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,421
- [Michael] Are you
listening to what I'm saying?

131
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,257
- Yes, and I think you're
overreacting a bit.

132
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,992
Gerard was only asking for your help.

133
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,893
- No he wasn't.

134
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,727
He ordered me around.

135
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,761
He made the distinction.

136
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,466
He said, "I am really
important and you are nothing."

137
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,600
- Come on, Michael.

138
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,436
You ought to be happy for him.

139
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,270
I am.

140
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,839
Gerard's worked hard for this promotion.

141
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,708
- Yeah well he better not
think I'm gonna bow and scrape

142
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,909
and be his obedient servant

143
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,143
for the rest of the trip.

144
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,914
- Shouldn't you be
checking on Abe and Zac?

145
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,915
- Don't you start.

146
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,689
(ship roars)

147
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,060
- How do you feel?

148
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,130
- Tampering with security
personnel is a punishable offense.

149
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,499
(electricity zaps)
- Ow!

150
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,734
What did you do that for?

151
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,470
- Security personnel?

152
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,373
- That boy there, don't
move another muscle.

153
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,577
Graffiti is not permitted on any wall.

154
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,746
- It's a calendar, you clown.

155
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,980
What's he raving about?

156
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,115
- [Edwina] We must use the asteroid

157
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,816
to slingshot us towards Jupiter.

158
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,118
It's our only chance.

159
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,120
We have three hours, so no slip-ups,

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,322
or we won't have enough
fuel to make it on our own.

161
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,156
Gerard?

162
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,991
- Commander, I'm still
getting the same warning.

163
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,826
Test run shows that the
forward impact lance

164
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,861
just won't release.

165
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,396
- [Edwina] Have you
double checked everything?

166
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,598
- Yeah but I can't pinpoint the fault.

167
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,966
- Haskell, this is your territory.

168
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,401
Get onto it, we're running out of time.

169
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,136
- Yes, but it's not a
straightforward problem.

170
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,571
The fault could be anywhere
on any of a hundred areas

171
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,141
starting here and going right through

172
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,609
to the lance mechanism itself.

173
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,144
There's a myriad of possibilities.

174
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,246
- Then I suggest you
narrow down your options,

175
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,814
because if you don't find the fault,

176
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,816
we'll have to rip the lance free.

177
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,817
- [Haskell] Ah no, you can't do that!

178
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,419
You'd need full power, and that'd use up

179
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,720
the rest of the fuel rods.

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,655
- Finally we agree, so I think

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,557
you'd better find me an alternative.

182
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,892
- Couldn't we just cut the cable?

183
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,628
- The cable runs through
a depressurized well.

184
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,229
It's a nice idea, but
it's far too dangerous

185
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,865
for anyone to be in there
when the thrusters are fired.

186
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,966
- I could give it a go.

187
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,269
- I can't take the risk,
please don't argue with me.

188
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,871
You're an ensign, not a service engineer.

189
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,740
Haskell!
- Yes, coming.

190
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,908
- [Edwina] Somewhere there is a solution

191
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,842
waiting to be found.

192
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,143
Let's not disappoint.

193
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,145
Where do you think you're going?

194
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,680
- [Gerard] I'm going
to check on the others,

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,582
see that they're toeing the line.

196
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,550
- Very good.

197
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,953
Anticipating a problem
before it happens, see to it.

198
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,989
Now, Haskell, I want some solutions.

199
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,957
- [Quadro] For your crimes,

200
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,059
this ship is to be cleaned bow to stern.

201
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,694
I want to see that wall spotless.

202
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,831
I want to see it so clean
I can see my face in it.

203
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,600
- I don't know why you want
to ruin a perfectly good wall!

204
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,902
Ow!

205
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,305
He's mad!

206
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,606
What have you done to him?

207
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,742
- Cut it out or I'll diffuse you.

208
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,411
(electricity zaps)

209
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,245
Ow!

210
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,148
You can't do that to me!

211
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:02,982
I'm your boss.

212
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,751
- I cannot disobey my primary functions.

213
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,920
- [Abe] What's he raving on about now?

214
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,455
- He used to be a security bot.

215
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,324
His old personality
chip must have kicked in

216
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,825
when his head fell off the table.

217
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,327
- Ah this is just great.

218
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,831
He doesn't have any other psycho
chips hidden away, does he?

219
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,534
- Enough chitchat, back
to mopping the floor.

220
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,869
It's much too slippery.

221
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:26,105
- Good, I hope he takes a dive
and smashes his head again.

222
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,177
(yells)
(groans)

223
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,446
What idiot spilled stuff
all over the floor?

224
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,414
- Don't blame me, it was the robot.

225
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,749
See he's turned totally mental.

226
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,584
See if you can do something.

227
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,786
- He's got us scrubbing the entire ship.

228
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,221
- Back to work.

229
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,257
A squillion apologies, Michael.

230
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,424
I do hope you're all right.

231
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,126
- [Michael] I'm fine, no thanks to them.

232
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,528
- I warned you two.

233
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,131
I'll see to it that they
get extra jobs for this.

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,868
(electricity zaps)
- Ow!

235
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,436
- I'm terribly sorry.

236
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,171
I do hope you won't lodge a complaint.

237
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,040
- Uh no, no.

238
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,975
But my room could do
with a bit of a clean.

239
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,111
- I'll have them see to it right away.

240
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,879
It's the last I could do for you.

241
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,848
- Michael, don't encourage him!

242
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,316
- Hey, if it keeps you busy

243
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,984
and Gerard off my back, I'm all for it.

244
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,319
- Indeed.

245
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,153
- Keep up the good work, Quadro

246
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,789
and how do you do that zappy thing?

247
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,458
- Oh, you mean this?

248
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,493
(electricity zaps)
- Ow!

249
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,230
- It's quite simple.
- This is unconstitutional!

250
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,165
(Michael chuckles)

251
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,267
- Well I'm sort of their insurance policy.

252
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,102
It's a titanium interlock cable,

253
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,871
but I should be able to
handle it with laser cutters.

254
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,506
- Handle what, what's with the hero suit?

255
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,241
- But Dent can't expect
you to do it on your own.

256
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,475
Someone should go with you to help.

257
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,310
- I'll be fine.

258
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,978
I've been trained for
these sort of emergencies.

259
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,047
That's why Dent specifically
asked me to do it.

260
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,381
- [Michael] Do what?

261
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,783
- She wants me to go
down to the cable well

262
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,684
and cut the cable.

263
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,319
It's the release mechanism.

264
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,620
- So, you should be able to do that

265
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,988
with one hand tied behind your back.

266
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,956
What's the big deal?

267
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,490
- It's a depressurized well.

268
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,593
I think you should stop
being a jerk and go with him.

269
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,961
- No way, don't look at me.

270
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,529
I'm a civilian, remember?

271
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,231
And besides, Abe and Zac
have been a real handful.

272
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,334
I have been unbelievably busy.

273
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,635
- Well I'll go with ya then.

274
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,804
- Fine by me.
- No you won't, all right?

275
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,638
I'm the professional here.

276
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,040
I can't expect you to
take these type of risks.

277
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,443
- What a hero.

278
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,478
It's amazing what some
extra brass buttons can do.

279
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,614
- [Kumiko] I don't know
what I ever saw in you.

280
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,753
- [Michael] Gerard,
wait, I'll go with you.

281
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,888
Seems you need someone to
keep you out of trouble.

282
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,423
- [Gerard] No you won't, I
don't need anyone down there

283
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,491
that doesn't know what they're doing.

284
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,593
Besides, Dent wouldn't allow it.

285
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,295
- We could talk to her, convince her.

286
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,129
- No you won't.

287
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,897
- Tell her you're
claustrophobic or something.

288
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,199
- Look just keep away from her, all right?

289
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,533
She's really busy.

290
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,368
Besides, I've already had a talk to her

291
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,136
and she flatly refused.

292
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,439
I'll keep in touch!

293
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,145
- Watch yourself down there, maverick.

294
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,580
Don't go trying to be a hero.

295
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,950
- [Haskell] The force has to
be in the retraction mechanics.

296
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,284
There's nowhere else.

297
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,421
Must have been damaged when
we crash landed on Mars.

298
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,255
- We're out of time.

299
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,523
We go with the alternative.

300
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,126
We'll have to rip it
free from the asteroid.

301
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,193
- Well perhaps Gerard was right.

302
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,663
Maybe there is a way that he
can cut the forward cable.

303
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,198
- That's not an option!

304
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,933
If we fire the thrusters,
he'll get sucked out

305
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,836
through the cable doors
like a leaf of limp lettuce.

306
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,506
(ominous music)

307
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,719
- [Quadro] You've missed a bit.

308
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,020
- Where?

309
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
- There, I can see a mark.

310
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,358
- [Zac] Impossible, we've
scrubbed the entire corridor!

311
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,327
- See, I've got blisters to prove it.

312
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,163
I think I'm gonna need medical attention.

313
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,666
- Ha, a mere blister never hurt anyone.

314
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,234
Back to work.

315
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,069
- Ow!

316
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,907
There must be some way to immobilize him.

317
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,743
- I've been thinking.

318
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:52,812
Maybe there is.

319
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,881
- It's Zac, your omnipotence.

320
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,583
I reckon it's cabin fever.

321
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,418
She's gone berserk with graffiti!

322
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,454
- Graffiti is a punishable offense.

323
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,155
She must be disciplined.

324
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,858
- Right, and a disciplined
ship is a happy ship.

325
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,859
- Excellent.

326
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,095
Perhaps one day I shall
promote you to hall monitor.

327
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,731
- Oh could I get one of those
zappy electrical fingers?

328
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,632
- That would be most inadvisable.

329
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,267
Humans are 90% water.

330
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,436
You'd electrocute yourself and die.

331
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,138
- Good point, never mind.

332
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,005
See there?

333
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,509
- Why are you wearing gloves?

334
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,312
- Blisters, so I can work
my fingers down to the bone.

335
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,048
- Excellent, and why
are you shaking so much?

336
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,418
- Nervous energy, so I can
obey your every command.

337
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,719
- Excellent.

338
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,087
Why is it so dark in here?

339
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,557
- Ah, so we can get you dumb schmuck, now!

340
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,892
(yelling)

341
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,227
Get him, Zac!

342
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,061
Got ya, ya maniac!

343
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,262
- [Quadro] Punishable offense.

344
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,563
Interfering with security staff

345
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,433
will invoke the--
- Tell it to the judge!

346
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,768
- [Quadro] Release me!

347
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,770
Release me this instant!

348
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,606
- [Computer] Warning, you are now entering

349
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,241
a depressurized zone.

350
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,879
(ominous music)

351
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,116
- I'm in the cable well.

352
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,620
Probably be a bit more
difficult than I thought.

353
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,889
It's pitch black down here.

354
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,158
I can't see a thing.

355
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,959
- [Kumiko] I knew one of us
should have gone with him.

356
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,327
- [Michael] Well he wouldn't let me.

357
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,029
- Well you didn't argue very hard.

358
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:17,830
- Why didn't you go?

359
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,598
- Well he wouldn't let me either!

360
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,200
- But as your warped logic would have it,

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,601
that doesn't seem to matter.

362
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,671
Why don't you just admit it?

363
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,906
You think I turned chicken on him.

364
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,474
- You said it Michael, not me.

365
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,610
Now tell him to sit tight.

366
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,347
(ominous music)

367
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,384
- Oh boy.

368
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,590
Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

369
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,393
I hope.

370
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,895
(machinery whirring)

371
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,163
Whatever you did, thanks.

372
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm gonna start with the laser cutters.

373
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,069
(ominous music)

374
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,740
(laser crackling)

375
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,779
- He's a strong bucket of bolts!

376
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,381
Hurry up and do something, grab his fuses!

377
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,016
- [Zac] I'm trying, keep him still!

378
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,518
- [Quadro] Seemed like a millennium.

379
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,753
Please release me, let me go.

380
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,890
- Behold the victor.

381
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:19,859
- Now what?

382
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,028
- I'll have to rewire his circuits.

383
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,930
We'll need the tools to take him apart.

384
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,099
- Good, I'm gonna enjoy this bit.

385
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,303
- Stand by to release rear cable.

386
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,038
- Standing by.

387
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,340
Don't let me down, not now.

388
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,508
You'll make me look like an idiot.

389
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,444
- That wouldn't be terribly difficult.

390
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,012
Hold on everybody.

391
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,848
(laser crackling)

392
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,887
Reverse thrust quarter power.

393
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,188
Release rear cable.

394
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,959
(Gerard grunts)

395
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,629
(ominous music)

396
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,367
- The cables.

397
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,668
They're releasing them!

398
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,437
- But they can't do that, not
while Gerard's down there.

399
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,072
Dent knows he'd be in danger.

400
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,308
- Maybe they don't know he's down there.

401
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,676
- What are you talking about?

402
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,811
- Maybe that's why he didn't
want us to talk to Dent.

403
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,414
He wanted to play hero all by himself.

404
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,849
- He wouldn't be that stupid.

405
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,853
Gerard, Gerard, respond please.

406
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,289
You have to get out of there.

407
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,491
They're releasing the cables.

408
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,325
Gerard?

409
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,861
Gerard!

410
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,695
Respond!

411
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,464
Gerard, come in please.

412
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,299
Answer me.

413
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,168
Michael, he's not responding.

414
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,770
- All right, get up there.

415
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,471
You have to stop them
from firing the thrusters.

416
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,973
Do whatever you have to do.

417
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,807
- What about you?

418
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,209
- [Michael] I should have gone
with him in the first place.

419
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,644
- Commander Dent?

420
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,746
Come in please, Commander Dent?

421
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,848
- Forget about the screen,
she's gonna be too busy

422
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,950
trying to free the ship.

423
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,185
You're gonna have to get up there.

424
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,120
- Get out of the way!
- Okay, okay.

425
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,655
What's the hurry?

426
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,856
- Who cares?

427
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,059
Let's get on with the robot torture.

428
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,962
- All right, we'll go to
work on the forward cable.

429
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,797
We'll rip it free as planned.

430
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,532
- I must advise against
this course of action.

431
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,167
It could rip the bottom out of the ship.

432
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,435
- I'll be sure to note your objection

433
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,303
on the computer log.

434
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,572
30 degree incline.

435
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,008
Quarter thrust in 10 seconds.

436
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,944
(ominous music)

437
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,046
- Maybe it's like amnesia.

438
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,915
If we clobber him hard enough...

439
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:25,884
- [Zac] No!

440
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,119
You'll explode his neurons!

441
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,120
- It serves him right!

442
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,456
- It's not his fault, it's
the way he was programmed!

443
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,691
- So we'll have to make
sure it never happens again.

444
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,693
(rumbling)
- What's that?

445
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,528
- Thrusters, hang on tight!

446
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,764
(rumbling)

447
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,106
That should do his
neurons a world of good.

448
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,742
- [Computer] Warning, depressurized zone.

449
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,709
- Gerard?
- Do not enter.

450
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,045
All personnel must clear--
- Gerard?

451
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,148
- Central thrusters engaged--
- Gerard!

452
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,516
- [Computer] And ready to fire.

453
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,884
- That cable's still attached.

454
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,221
I want power in 25 seconds, standby.

455
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,857
Upthrust only.
- No, stop!

456
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,858
Commander you can't!

457
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,692
- 20 seconds.

458
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,727
Kumi this is our only chance
to clear the asteroid.

459
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,862
Please, don't interrupt.

460
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,597
- But you can't, you don't understand.

461
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,498
- Kumi, what's the matter?

462
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,200
- Haskell, I said full
power on all thrusters.

463
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,069
That's an order, in 15 seconds.

464
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,270
- Please listen.

465
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,772
You'll kill him!

466
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,706
Gerard's in the cable well.

467
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,207
He's trying to cut the cable.

468
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,776
You sent him there!

469
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,110
- I gave no such order.

470
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,345
- But he said you did.

471
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,380
You knew he was there and you
still fired the thrusters.

472
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,481
- I knew no such thing.

473
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,983
He had no right to be in there!

474
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,651
I ordered him not to.

475
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,585
- Kumi, it's true Commander.

476
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,187
Six seconds, what do we do?

477
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,256
- Please listen, Michael's down there too.

478
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,192
- One second, Commander.
- Abort the firing!

479
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,962
(ominous music)

480
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,306
- [Michael] You all right?

481
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,140
Can you move?

482
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,078
- [Gerard] Feel like
I've been hit by a bus.

483
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,281
- Don't worry, I got its number.

484
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,016
Can you move?

485
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,956
- Oh my cranial cavity.

486
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,425
The indignity of it all.

487
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,962
I do wish people would stop
using me as a battering ram.

488
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,630
- I think he's back.

489
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,832
- [Michael] He's taken a hit on the head,

490
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,066
but I think he's okay.

491
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,168
- Can you get him out of there?

492
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,571
- In 11 minutes?
- In 11 minutes?

493
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,073
- It's 11 minutes or we'll be
past the point of no return.

494
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,174
Can you get him out?

495
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,609
- [Michael] Yeah, I think so.

496
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,478
He's okay, he's coming round.

497
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,680
- [Gerard] I must have
hit my head on the wall

498
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,448
when they released the rear cable.

499
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,050
- [Michael] Come on, I'm
gonna need your help.

500
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,819
What were you trying to
prove down here, anyway?

501
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,789
- [Gerard] I knew Dent was
worried about the cable.

502
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,858
I could've cut it if I
hadn't smashed my head.

503
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,593
- [Michael] Well you're
lucky you're still alive.

504
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,128
- [Gerard] Wait, the cable.

505
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
I've got to cut it,
where's the laser cutters?

506
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,165
- [Michael] You're not in
any condition to do anything.

507
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,166
You've gotta get that wound seen to.

508
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,167
- [Gerard] We gotta cut the cable,

509
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,269
or else my career's history.

510
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,103
- [Michael] You should've
thought of that before.

511
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,838
Now go on, get out of here.

512
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,041
Kumi, what about the cable?

513
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,410
- Eight minutes.
- Forget the cable!

514
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,446
We'll use the thrusters
to rip the lance free.

515
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,348
- I repeat, I can't
give you any guarantees.

516
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,983
- Then I'll give you a guarantee.

517
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,418
If we don't get clear of this
asteroid, we're finished.

518
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,354
- Well if you use up all
the fuel, we're stranded,

519
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,722
same result by my reckoning.

520
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,290
- You better hope we're
close enough to Ganymede

521
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,192
to be picked up by their scanners.

522
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,326
Clear the cable well.

523
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,128
You've got seven minutes.

524
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,797
(ominous music)

525
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,402
- [Gerard] Thanks for
trying to convince her.

526
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,471
- [Michael] Forget about
it, just keep moving.

527
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,805
I'll be right behind you.

528
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,408
We're on our way.

529
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,882
Seven minutes.

530
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,052
Lucky seven.

531
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,356
- Bring the ion drives to full capacity.

532
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,291
I want everything it's got

533
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,226
in five minutes, stand by thrusters.

534
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,060
- Standing by.

535
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,764
(intense music)

536
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:09,441
(hatch creaks)

537
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,610
- [Zac] Gerard, what happened to you?

538
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,111
- [Abe] Where have you been?

539
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,814
- You're bleeding!
- I'm fine.

540
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,083
- [Quadro] Oh goodness me, no.

541
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,819
A definite laceration to
the upper left forehead.

542
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,556
In my medical experience, we
should apply firm pressure

543
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,692
to prevent excessive blood loss.

544
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,893
- [Gerard] Can you tell him to stop?

545
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
- [Zac] He was just trying to do his job.

546
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,762
- And it's a nice change from psycho bot.

547
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,131
- That was a really dumb thing to do.

548
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,366
You could've been killed.

549
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,300
- I know all right, but save it.

550
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,169
I've already had the lecture from Michael.

551
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,371
- Where is he?
- He's right behind me.

552
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,206
- [Kumiko] We'll have
to get you to first aid.

553
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,508
- [Gerard] I'll be all right, just--

554
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,343
- Uh-oh.

555
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,178
Michael!

556
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,382
(laser crackling)

557
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,883
- [Michael] Come on, cut!

558
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,819
I could go faster with a blunt spoon.

559
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,558
- [Edwina] All right Haskell,
let's rip that cable out.

560
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,293
- Two minutes remaining.

561
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,928
Ion drives engaged.

562
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,696
- Stand by thrusters.

563
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,531
- Michael, get out of there!

564
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,000
I've gotta get him out of there.

565
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,134
- There's no time!

566
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,970
(laser crackling)

567
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,174
(intense music)

568
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,048
- Edwina, we've lost the cable!

569
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,250
♪ We've lost the cable
we've lost the cable ♪

570
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,753
♪ We've lost the cable yes ♪

571
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,687
- Well done, Haskell.

572
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,521
- I didn't do a thing.

573
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,722
I wish I did, but I didn't.

574
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,424
I just don't know what's happened.

575
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,525
- Let's not worry about it now.

576
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,194
Just get us away from this rock!

577
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,234
- We've lost him.

578
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,042
- Exit denied.
- Come on!

579
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,777
- [Computer] All service hatches secured.

580
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,811
Exit denied.

581
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,514
- [Michael] All right
then, stupid computer!

582
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,183
(intense music)

583
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,490
(dramatic music)

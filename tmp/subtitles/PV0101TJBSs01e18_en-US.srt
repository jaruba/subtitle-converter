00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:29,704
<b>MY SAFE AND CAREFUL DRIVING,</b>
<b>AND IN MY EXPERT OPINION I</b>
<b>THINK THAT

133
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:33,708
<b>CAR A WOULD HAVE MISSED CAR B</b>
<b>IF HE HAD BEEN ON HIS TOES. OH</b>
<b>NO

134
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:37,745
<b>I DISAGREE, I THINK IT WAS ALL</b>
<b>THE FAULT OF CAR B

135
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,749
<b>NOW YOU SEE, CAR A WAS GOING</b>
<b>STRAIGHT DOWN THIS LANE

136
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:45,787
<b>BUT CAR B CROSSED OVER THE</b>
<b>DOUBLE LINE. HOW MANY ACCIDENTS

137
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:49,791
<b>FREE MILES HAVE YOU HAD MADAM?</b>
<b>OH I DON''T DRIVE.

138
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,895
<b>MY HUSBAND WOULD'NT LET ME NEAR</b>
<b>A STEERING WHEEL.

139
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:57,865
<b>ALL I KNOW IF CAR A AND CAR B</b>
<b>HAD

140
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:01,936
<b>STAYED HOME I COULD HAVE BEEN</b>
<b>ON VACATION NOW. WHY SPOIL AND</b>
<b>GOOD THING

141
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:06,007
<b>WERE GETTING FIVE DOLLARS A DAY</b>
<b>AND CARE FARE.

142
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:10,011
<b>AND MY OLD MAN'S BEEN OUT OF</b>
<b>WORK A YEAR, AND FIVE DOLLARS A</b>
<b>DAY AINT CHOPPED LIVER.

143
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:14,015
<b>PLEASE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN MAY</b>
<b>WE CONFINE OUR CONVERSATION TO</b>
<b>THE

144
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:18,086
<b>CASE AT HAND. THE WHOLE THING</b>
<b>IS VERY SIMPLE

145
00:10:18,086 --> 00:10:22,090
<b>CAR A WAS COMING ONE WAY CAR BE</b>
<b>WAS GOING

146
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,127
<b>ANOTHER, THEY MET POW, LETS</b>
<b>VOTE.

147
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:30,164
<b>MR BARNES THIS CASE CANNOT BE</b>
<b>SETTLED BY A SIMPLE POW

148
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:34,202
<b>NOW THE DEFENDANT IN CAR A THAT</b>
<b>CAR C

149
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:38,272
<b>PULLED OUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT</b>
<b>HE FORCED CAR B OVER INTO THE</b>
<b>PATHWAY OF CAR A

150
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:42,310
<b>MAY I SAY SOMETHING? GO RIGHT</b>
<b>AHEAD. I'M A CITIZEN OF THE</b>

<b>THERE STILL IS ONE LITTLE THING

215
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,529
<b>THAT CONFUSES ME, NOW THE</b>

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,600
<b>DRIVING NORTH AT A SPEED OF</b>
<b>TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR.

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,604
<b>EXCUSE ME LADY, I DISTINCTLY</b>
<b>HEARD THE DEFENDANT SAY HE WAS</b>
<b>GOING FORTY FIVE

218
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:40,641
<b>MILES AN HOUR. NO DEAR, HE SAID</b>
<b>TWENTY

219
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,712
<b>FIVE MILES AN HOUR. I HEARD HIM</b>
<b>WITH MY OWN EARS, HE WAS GOING

<b>FORTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. I</b>
<b>DON'T WANT TO SEEM RUDE BUT I'M</b>
<b>INCLINED

00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:56,857
<b>BUT IF WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT</b>
<b>THE SPEED OF THE DEFENDANT'S</b>
<b>CAR WOULD BE

223
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:00,928
<b>AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS CASE</b>
<b>AND SINCE THERE SEEMS TO BE</b>
<b>SOME DOUBT I WOULD SUGGEST

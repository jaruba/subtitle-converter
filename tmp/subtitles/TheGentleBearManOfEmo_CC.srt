to him softly, calmly.

a cute little baby you are."

stuff through the mesh wire.

to do with me.

following year when he came back

98
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:57,834

was the one that seemed

to go out and feed him.

just a really nice bear.

get into fights with anybody.

107
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,709
No matter how hungry he
is if another bear comes,

108

he wants to join him,
he just lets him.

He won't chase him off
like the other bears.

That's what wakes me up.

Sometimes there's
one, up to five

out of my mouth when
he was little.

122
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:05,959
As he got bigger, every fall,
he'd bring cubs with him.

123
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,709
It is odd that a male
bear would bring cubs.

124

They're supposed to kill them,
everything I'd ever learned.

125
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,792
And one year he brought
five cubs.

126
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,918
They were either orphaned
or abandoned, we don't know

127
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:21,709
where he picked them up.

128
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:22,792
He'd bring them to
the troughs, they ate,

129
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,459
he lay down while they ate,
then he ate, then they'd all go.

130
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:29,999
Betty, my wife, wondered

131
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,083
if perhaps he knew what it
was like to be an orphan.

132
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,999
We don't know what's
going on in his head.

133
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,918
But it was those
instances and other things

134
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:43,000
that were happening here why
I remembered somewhere back

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,542
in my youth, either hearing a
scripture or having read it,

136
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:52,250
something about a bear and a
calf, and a lion and a kid.

137
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,209
And so I started researching
my bible and I found Isaiah 11.

138
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,751
And so I believe this was a
foreshadow of what is coming.

139

It's not here yet but it's a

in that day when all
will be at peace.

141
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,834
The lion will lay with the
lamb, the bear will graze

142
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,334

got written there,

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,667
their young will
lie down together.

160
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,999
And the lion will eat
straw like the ox.

161
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,834
Michael believes that ancient
prophecy may just be coming

162
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:04,709
true-right here in
his back yard.

163
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:12,000
>> MICHAEL: That's pretty
cool, these two playing.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,999
>> NARRATOR: Sanctuary
is not just in the name

165
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:18,209
of this unusual place.

166
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,626
It's a special word for Michael.

167
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,999
A sanctuary for the injured,
the abandoned, the orphaned.

168
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:27,792
>> MICHAEL: Well, every year,
the third weekend in August,

169
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:31,459
they have what's
called the Emo Fair.

170
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,292
I get a call the day
that they're setting

171
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,999
up from this guy telling
me he's got a raccoon,

172
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,792
he's been carrying it
with him for two months.

173
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,709
He was trying to find a place to
bring her because it just lives

174
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,999
in a trailer with him,
traveling all over the place.

175
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,959
He wondered if we
could take care of her,

176
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,167
so I said, "I'll be right down."

177
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,667
I picked her up, heard the
story of where they found her

178
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:58,292
in a camp ground almost dead.

179
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,751
Just barely able to
navigate at night.

180
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:02,334
He figured the mother had been
hurt and he did a great thing.

181
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:06,834
He did call the government, they
insisted that it was illegal

182
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:10,125
for him to have her
and that he bring her

183
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,459
down so they can give her
a needle and put her down.

184
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,083
He said, "No, that
ain't happening."

185
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,792
So, I picked her up.

186
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,167
And I told the daughter, who was
15, I told her that I'm going

187
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:25,626
to call her "Destiny" because
of all the different things

188
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,999
that had to happen.

189
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,209
All the perfect timing, all
these things had to happen

190
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,417
for her to end up
here at Isaiah 11.

191
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,417
That's the only name I
could give her, "Destiny."

192
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:36,999
It was her destiny to be here.

193
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,584
I give her milk,
and all raccoons

194
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:42,876
for some reason just
love Butter Tarts.

195
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,626
So she gets that, she
gets raisin bread soaked

196
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,918
in milk and corn on the cob.

197
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:50,000
She loves corn on the cob,

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,584
which I guess is a
natural raccoon diet.

199
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,167
You're not going under the
deck, it's a little too early.

200
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:57,999
She's number fourteen.

201
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,792
Fourteen raccoons we've
rescued and released.

202
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,999
Some of them, when
they got here they were

203
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,334
so small their eyes
were just opening.

204
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,542
Everybody gets along here.

205
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:13,542
The birds play.

206
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,834
. . the bird plays
with the cats and...

207
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,667
It's just amazing the
stuff that goes on here.

208
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,042
Say bye! Bye bye!

209
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,999
Bye bye, bye bye!

210
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,999
>> NARRATOR: As Michael opened
up his property and his heart

211
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:30,083
to these animals, unusual
things began to happen.

212
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,250
>> MICHAEL: A mother
with three cubs shows up.

213
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,999
She brings the three cubs
on the deck and leaves.

214
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:40,626
I'm going, "I don't
believe this is happening."

215
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,209
Why would this strange bear
bring her three cubs here?

216
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,584
I'm bottle-feeding them,
they're fighting over treats,

217
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:50,876
and then twenty minutes
later she comes

218
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,250
and all she does is eat
out of my hand, too.

219
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,626
What is going on here?

220
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,999
And then all these other bears,
all these things that happen.

221
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,167
What is going on here?

222
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,125
I've got no training for this.

223
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,999
I don't have any
degrees or initials

224
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,751
in front or behind my name.

225
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,167
What is going on here?

226
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,751
That's why I call it Isaiah 11.

227
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,209
A male bear is not supposed
to share cake with cubs.

228
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:15,999
I've got photographs.

229
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,999
There he is.

230
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,167
Big, big male sharing a cake
with three cubs and the mom.

231
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,083
This is just one of the trails
I've blasted through here.

232
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,501
Man, I used to walk,
and my wife used

233
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,999
to walk all the time
around the property.

234
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,334
The other thing I've noticed

235
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,959
about the bears is
how sociable they are

236
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,000
and how they remember each other
from generation to generation.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,999
Sometimes they'll be
separated from the fall before

238
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:43,626
and they'll come together for
the last couple of months.

239
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,250
They'll remember, "Oh,
there's food here."

240
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,375
And all of a sudden
they'll show up.

241
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,501
There will be a little bit

242
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:50,959
of nattering then you'll see
them going slowly towards each

243
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,542
other, sniffing noses, they eat,

244
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,375
then they romp, playing
together.

245
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,876
I know who they are.

246
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,959
I'm like, "You're the
generation before.

247
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,709
This is your step-sister,
or your step brother."

248
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:02,709
Or something, whatever.

249
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:03,999
So I know when one of these
are killed a whole bunch

250
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,417
of them are affected by that.

251
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:10,125
I see it when there's
one that arrives sick.

252
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,999
They seem to sense that there's
something wrong with this bear,

253
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,292
and they'll do like a protection
to make sure he's getting food.

254
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,999
They'll back off and let it eat.

255
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,417
Oh, there's one sitting
right there.

256
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:24,375
Hey, there we go.

257
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:24,999
That's Milo.

258
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:27,167
C'mon Milo.

259
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,167
See, he wasn't worried
about our voice,

260
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,834
he was just wanting
to hit that brush.

261
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,375
One thing I notice about
bears, see this one here ran,

262
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,667
not because of our voices
or because they saw us,

263
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,709
but because I brushed
against that branch.

264
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,999
One thing I noticed early on
is bears actually use weapons

265
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,834
as a tool against
something they want

266
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:47,125
to chase away, to scare away.

267
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,626
And what they'll do is they'll
simply go in behind something

268
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:52,459
like this, and they'll
smack it down.

269
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,709
Just smack!

270
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,876
One time I had, when I was first
starting this, I had a mom,

271
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:04,584
two moms and their cubs by this
one tree here and I was going

272
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:08,959
over there to feed them.

273
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:09,999
Both moms charge me
at the same time.

274
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,125
Each had their own little tree.

275
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,876
They smacked it on the
ground and warned me.

276
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:15,334
So I said, "Okay, here you go."

277
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,999
And I just threw it to
them and they were okay.

278
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:19,792
I don't know if anybody
knows this,

279
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,083
that bears actually
use tools as a weapon

280
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,876
to help drive off something
they want to chase away.

281
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,667
They'll use a tree, a small
sapling, and to whip it down.

282
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,792
It just makes a sound like
a whip hitting the ground.

283
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,999
That's pretty cool.

284
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,751
So, I'm not a bear expert but
I am learning all the time.

285
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,792
Different things I pick up.

286
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,999
I have to keep my little
trail clean, you know?

287
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:47,250
Well, back when I was six years
old I was given the choice

288
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,751
about a puppy in a basement

289
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,250
in Winnipeg cause we
were leaving the city

290
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,876
to move onto a farm.

291
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,584
They took me down some stairs to
the basement, there was a litter

292
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,999
of puppies and one of
them left the litter

293
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,292
and come running over to me.

294
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,626
I picked him up and
figured that's the one,

295
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,584
cause he likes me.

296
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,709
So, I figured I'd take this
one, and I called him Moxy.

297
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:15,918
I have no idea where
that came from.

298
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,334
I don't even know what it means
but that's what I called him.

299
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:22,999
This puppy, he brought
a connection to me.

300
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,083
He was something that
loved me no matter what.

301
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:31,334
No matter how bad I was, no
matter how many spankings I got

302
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:34,042
from my parents he still
licked my hand and my face.

303
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:38,042
To him I wasn't a bad person.

304
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:41,209
So I grew this really, really
tight bond with this little dog

305
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,709
that we then went
to the country with.

306
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,834
So, with this puppy called Moxy,
it was my first introduction

307
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:56,501
to an animal that
I can remember.

308
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,999
A couple of years later we
had some company from Winnipeg

309
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,584
and we had very little food.

310
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:14,709
The fact that we were
even alive is a miracle

311
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,334
because there was no
welfare back then.

312
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:17,959
There was no back up system.

313
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,375
So, I remember the dog
eating basically scraps.

314
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,834
Potatoes! Can you imagine
dog eating potatoes?

315
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:27,167
Whatever we had, so
the dog was always

316
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,999
on the verge of starvation.

317
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,292
I mean, so were we.

318
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,083
We had some people come over.

319
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,459
This little girl
went over to his dish

320
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,792
that he'd just been
given some scrap food

321
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:37,918
and she went over to his dish.

322
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:38,959
The dog nipped her
just above the eye.

323
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,751
And of course she
comes in screaming,

324
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,999
got everybody all upset.

325
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,334
My dog's full-grown now.

326
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:52,542
The next thing I remember, I see
my father has my dog on a rope

327
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:57,834
and he's got the
twenty-two in his hand

328
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,125
and he's walking
off into the bush.

329
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,542
I'm screaming and yelling,
bawling my head off.

330
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:06,501
I don't know what
he's going to do

331
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,999
with it, it doesn't look good.

332
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,000
Then I watched them fade off

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,999
through the meadow
and into the trees.

334
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:17,999
You know, that day
was a turning point

335
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:25,667
in my life towards
how I saw my father.

336
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,918
And it wasn't good.

337
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:33,999
A murderous spirit rose up in
me that was just so violent.

338
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:40,999
And unfortunately I took
it out on my siblings.

339
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:47,501
I was very cruel to them.

340
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,626
I had a real resistance
to anything

341
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:55,167
that wanted to be
attached to me.

342
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:59,584
Because something was
going to happen to it.

343
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:05,417
It was going to either
die or be killed.

344
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:09,999
>> NARRATOR: Running
Paradise isn't easy.

345
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,834
In fact, it's a lot
of hard work.

346
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:14,334
There's no such thing
as Purina "Bear" Chow.

347
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,999
So, four times a
week, Michael gets

348
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,999
in his 1998 GMC pickup truck

349
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,459
and makes the 70 mile round
trip into town for food.

350
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:25,000
His truck has over
270,000 miles on it.

351
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
>> MICHAEL: I just call my
buddy and he just nods his head,

352
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,667
"Yeah, you're right, yeah, yeah.

353
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:31,584
You got that right, yeah.

354
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:33,834
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah."

355
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,167
[ chuckle ]

356
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,542
It's a 24/7, 365 days a year job
with this wildlife sanctuary.

357
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:45,999
There is always food
to be gathered up.

358
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,000
The one break I get
is in the wintertime

359
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,167
where I only have
to go twice a week.

360
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:55,125
But in the summer time I've
got to go four times a week

361
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,999
into Fort Francis
to pick up this food

362
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,209
because we're always day-to-day.

363
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,999
Isn't that right buddy?

364
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:06,999
"Yeah, you got it."

365
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,999
I hate when food is wasted.

366
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,876
I just can't stand it
because of the way I grew

367
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:13,709
up we didn't have much.

368
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,751
It would be perfectly
fine with me

369
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,250
if there was never
any stuff thrown away,

370
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,999
it all went to people.

371
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,918
That would be fine with me

372
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:26,999
because then I know God
would provide some other way

373
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,918
for the animals.

374
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,834
But in the mean time,

375
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:31,999
while they're doing this
why take it to the dump?

376
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:35,999
Might as well make
some good use out of it

377
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:37,584
and feed the wildlife
that needs it.

378
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,999
I mean, it sounds like
a simple meal for bears,

379
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,042
but there's so much minerals
and vitamins and stuff in bread.

380
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:45,292
That's why their coats
are so healthy looking.

381
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:48,876
Isn't that right buddy?

382
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,083
"Yeah."

383
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:50,876
[ chuckle ]

384
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:55,918
One time I had two guys
and their girlfriends here

385
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:59,125
in their mid-twenties.

386
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,292
The girls were in the
back and this whole trip

387
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,999
through here they were
laughing and giggling.

388
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,751
I got to about there and I
turned around and I said,

389
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:06,999
"I realize you guys
aren't laughing

390
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,375
because something's funny,
you guys are laughing

391
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,999
because you're scared
stiff, right?"

392
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:13,417
Then one of the girls says
"Well, we were talking about,

393
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:16,709
what are we going to do if a
bear comes out of the woods.

394
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,834
What are we going to do?"

395
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,792
I said, "Well, you can pray."

396
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,584
[ chuckles ]

397
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:27,834
>> NARRATOR: Michael's
parents left Nazi Germany

398
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:31,083
after Hitler's defeat
and immigrated to Canada.

399
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,709
Life was harsh, and cruel.

400
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:38,918
And sometimes, so were they.

401
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:43,584
There was a lot of abuse
from the parents towards us.

402
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,999
Some of the abuse I don't
want to, you know, it's...

403
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,999
From a young age my sister and
I were planning on running away.

404
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,999
And actually one day we did.

405
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:09,042
In the middle of winter
we packed our little slay

406
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,417
and we were running
away from home.

407
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,000
We were five and six
years old probably.

408
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,459
Or four and five.

409
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:17,083
Something like that.

410
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,542
I was terrified of my father.

411
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,584
Both parents, terrified of them.

412
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:26,999
My sister and I would, she's a
year and a half younger than me,

413
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:31,334
I'm the oldest of eleven.

414
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:35,375
If our parents left the house

415
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,125
to go somewhere we would
secretively, quietly whisper

416
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,999
in a corner of the, wherever
we were, try and come

417
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,792
up with a plan of how
we could kill them.

418
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:51,334
Whether people like to hear it
or not it's part of my past.

419
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:56,918
It's part of the healing that my
gracious heavenly father brought

420
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,959
me through.

421
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,209
The first time I attempted
suicide I was nine years old.

422
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:04,501
Now, can you imagine a child?

423
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:09,584
I had witnessed my uncles and
my father killing an animal.

424
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:15,667
What they did was they took a
hammer and they hit the calf

425
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:20,999
or the cow on the
head with this hammer.

426
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,167
It fell to the ground and
then they would cut the throat

427
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:27,459
and bleed it.

428
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:28,999
Well, in my young little
mind it was the hammer blow

429
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:31,667
that killed the animal.

430
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:32,999
So one day when I was down in
the barnyard working with the,

431
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:38,542
whatever I was doing
there, I took a hammer

432
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,459
and I walloped myself right

433
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,999
between the eyes
with this hammer.

434
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,709
And all I ended up with is
this great big mouse on my head

435
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,999
and I had to lie to my
mother how it got there.

436
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,876
Then a couple of years later
I tried to hang myself.

437
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,834
I got scars on the bottom of my
neck here, but the rope broke.

438
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:06,999
Going to Fort Francis, which is

439
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,999
like a thirty-five mile
one way trip and picking

440
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:12,501
up at the different
destinations.

441
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:13,999
It usually takes me a
couple, a couple and a half,

442
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:19,999
it's sometimes even three hours
cause I might have to wait

443
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,999
for one of the bread
trucks to come back.

444
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:25,459
So there goes the morning.

445
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:26,999
Then I go home and I sort

446
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:29,292
through everything,
separate everything.

447
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,999
There goes another hour.

448
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,042
And then it's feeding's
another hour.

449
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,667
So the whole morning is
until noon, one o'clock,

450
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,876
is usually dedicated
every two days just

451
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:40,709
to get the food together.

452
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,751
Get it in the tubs
and get it sorted out.

453
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:45,292
Get the doughnuts and
the cakes sorted out.

454
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:48,209
Then the doughnuts
and stuff I hold back,

455
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,999
they're just treats for...

456
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,709
The little girl waved.

457
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,834
The horns, they love
the horns on the truck

458
00:23:54,834 --> 00:24:01,209
[ chuckle ]

459
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:02,250
. Some people might
think that bears,

460
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,417
that all they're getting
is the sweets and stuff,

461
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,959
but they're just the treats.

462
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:07,999
The cakes are held back
for the moms with cubs

463
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:10,167
so they can produce milk
better and the doughnuts

464
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:13,667
and the cookies are
all held back, always,

465
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,709
for when people show up.

466
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,250
If nobody shows up and
I've got pails left,

467
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,334
then I just fire
them out for them.

468
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,209
So the bears have an all-raw,
very, very healthy diet.

Michael forages for food

482
00:25:33,918 --> 00:25:36,209
for his beloved bears.

483
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:37,542
They're only three weeks
away from hibernation

484
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:40,999
and the bears need a
remarkable 24,000 calories a day

485

to store fat for the winter.

friends with the folks

487

And I do go without a lot.

510
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,999
It's been a really neat
experience having what the Bible

511
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:19,209
would call "sparrow faith."

512
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,792
When God says, "The
sparrow don't worry

513
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,876
about what he's going to
eat, I feed him every day."

514
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,999
So he says, "don't worry about
what you're going to wear,

515
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,999
don't worry about what
you're going to eat.

516

I'll look after you."

517
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,000
That was the plan all along.

518
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,459
Right from Adam on,
that was the plan.

519
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,209
And we're getting
back to that so I have

to worry about the supplies,

not to worry about the food.

522

going to see it through.

to provide the manna every day.

525
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:06,334
In the spring or summer we were
each given a little ducking,

526
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:14,083
my sister and I, to look after.

527
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,959
It was our job to raise it,
make sure they had food,

528
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,959
make sure they had water.

529
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,334
We assumed they were our pets.

530
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:22,999
And we treated them as such.

531
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:25,501
We had no idea that they were
going to go on the dinner plate

532
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,999
when they were bigger.

533
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,334
So one day, out of the blue,
my mother tells me to go down

534
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,125
and get one of the ducks and
kill it on the chopping block.

535
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:38,125
And I was, "What?!"

536
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,959
I mean, I did't say that because
you don't question anything.

537
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:45,250
When they said do
something you...

538
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,918
See, there was no communication

539
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,999
in our house except,
"yes" or "no."

540
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,667
You don't ask, you don't
question, you just do.

541
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:55,959
I remember picking up this
duck, which was a good size now

542
00:28:55,959 --> 00:29:00,459
and walking what seemed like
a long walk from the building

543
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:03,959
where it was up to the woodshed
to where the chopping block

544
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,999
and the ax were, and
apologizing to it profusely.

545
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:09,083
I said, "I don't
want to do this.

546
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,042
I don't want to kill you."

547
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:13,375
But my, I had, my mother want...

548
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,125
"I don't want to do this."

549
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,501
And so then she opens the
door and hollers out, again,

550
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:22,250
in German you know, "Have
you got that done yet?"

551
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,999
And I'm standing there
with the duck and I said,

552
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:27,000
"I don't want to do this!

553
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,292
I don't want to kill!"

554
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:29,792
And then she started
hurling insults at me.

555
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:33,999

she grabbed me

561
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,918
and like this, kinda shook me.

hand, put it on the block,

it on the duck.

564

took her hand over my hand,

565

lifted up the ax and
chopped its head off.

566

The second that ax chopped
that ducks head off...

567
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:10,375
the fury, the anger,
the murderous spirit

was almost out of control.

Rage. That is not something
you put a child through.

570
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:22,959
A child should not
have to kill anything

571

because it will set the tone in
your spirit for years to come.

life anymore.

00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:07,709
How can I set them free?

784
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:08,999
But I realized that if I
set these wolves and tigers,

785
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,709
they're all going to get killed

786
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:12,792
because they're going
to be in the city.

787
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:13,667
They're going to be shot.

788
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:14,375
I can't just release them.

789
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,334
So I turned away from going to
zoos cause I couldn't handle it.

790
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:31,999
What you doing up there, eh?

Whoops. Yes sir.

798
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,999
So I try to study
characteristics of the bear,

799
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:07,083
because that's the only
way to remember them.

800
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,167
Because when they're cubs,
like these cubs, okay,

801
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,751
I might be able to tell a
difference between some of them.

802
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:13,959
But when they come back next
spring I'll have no clue

803
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,999
who they are.

804
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,042
So by paying attention
to different movements

805
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,375
that they make or how they,
just even a movement of the head

806
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,375
or whatever, I can pin
them and say, "Okay.

807
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,667
Oh, this is so-and-so."

That's who that is!"

811
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,083
Cause him and Milo, I know
that's Milo because one,

812
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,542
he had a limited amount
of black female cubs

813

Well, that's Milo.

815

Well, what happened to Otis?

816
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,999
Well, forgetting that he'd grown
much bigger than her already

817
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:49,042
and he's now a big male.

818

Nice and relaxing.

941
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,459
>> BETTY: I've had so many
people that have come to see

942
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:33,709
that bears that comment
on how relaxed,

943
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:36,876
how peaceful it is here.

944
00:54:36,876 --> 00:54:40,042
They come here afraid.

945
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,501
A lot of them has come here
afraid, and we have to talk them

946
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:44,125
out of the vehicle to
come and see the bears.

947
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:45,999
And then you can't
get them to go home.

948
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:54,000
You know?

949
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,250
You can't go three or
four blocks down the road

950
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,417
and see somebody else
doing this same thing, eh?

951
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:20,626
It's... yeah.

952
00:55:20,626 --> 00:55:21,876
>> MICHAEL: Well, we have
critics near and far.

953
00:55:21,876 --> 00:55:24,459
>> NARRATOR: Not everyone has
been supportive of Michael

954
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:30,626
and his special sanctuary.

955
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:32,667
While many people would have
no problem feeding wild birds

956
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,834
from a bird feeder or
putting food out for squirrels

957
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:38,959
or any other wild animals,

958
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:40,584
some critics believe it's
morally wrong to feed the bears.

959
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:46,083
>> MICHAEL: Well, you
shouldn't feed the bears

960
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,792
because you should let Mother
Nature take its course.

961
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:51,459
We're supposed to be caretakers.

962
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:52,918
So I'm just taking
care of my little spot

963
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:57,876
of creation, is all I'm doing.

964
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:02,083
That my feeding these animals
is to help them survive.

965
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:07,501
What is so wrong with
that, why are you so upset?

966
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:12,417
Well, these bears are
going to go kill people.

967
00:56:12,417 --> 00:56:15,709
No they're no.

968
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,334
I've got people phoning me up,
coming here and mocking me,

969
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:20,834
saying, "Well, Michael, how
many born again bears do you

970
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:23,459
have now?"

971
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:24,667
Here you go, come on
Anson, come on Lightning.

972
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:27,292
Here we go, here we go.

973
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,999
Come on, here you go.

974
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,834
Here you go, there you are.

975
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:33,000
Here you are, come
one, here we go.

976
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,125
Here you are.

977
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,999
Here you guys go, good shot.

978
00:56:40,999 --> 00:56:47,834
Here you go, here
you are, here we go.

979
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:52,167
Good girl, come on.

980
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:55,876
This is Anson, little Missy,
and that's Lightening.

981
00:56:55,876 --> 00:57:02,209
These cubs are disciplined
by their mom for a reason.

982
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:06,876
To learn how to survive
they must obey.

983
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,751
They must obey everything
the mother tells them.

984
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:12,459
As I watch them,
every single detail

985
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:14,375
that she teaches
them, it's incredible.

986
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,667
It's all to survive.

987
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,584
What to eat, when it's
going to be where.

988
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:21,584
You know, when to run, when
to attack, and to listen.

989
00:57:21,584 --> 00:57:25,083
What noises to respond to.

990
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,999
It's amazing.

991
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:28,999
Want some pie Milo?

992
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,375
Eh, want some apple pie.

993
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:33,125
Come and get it.

994
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:40,459
Her and Otis were abandoned
by their mother in the middle

995
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:45,834
of May because that bear
Chocolate came around

996
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:49,083
and he was determined
he was going

997
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,375
to breed her even though
she had these new born cubs.

998
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,042
And I called them Milo and Otis

999
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:55,250
because of the Walt Disney show
<i>The Incredible Journey </i>and I

1000
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,792
thought these two guys are
kind of lost, you know.

1001
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:02,209
Like all these cubs, we've
got eighteen of them here.

1002
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:05,999
Eighteen little ones this
year, they're all going to be

1003
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:08,584
in for a nasty shock
come next spring.

1004
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:12,209
About May the mothers will
start driving them off.

1005
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:16,167
We're going to have
a whole yard full

1006
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:17,667
of confused cubs not knowing
why their mothers don't love

1007
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,999
them anymore.

1008
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,876
The cubs will go up, they'll be
way up on top of those trees,

1009
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:24,999
laying out on top of
the boughs sound asleep.

1010
00:58:24,999 --> 00:58:27,584
A nice little breeze, and
the mom's sometimes will lay

1011
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,334
down at the bottom
and sleep with them.

1012
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:32,083
Or they'll go up the tree
part ways and sleep with them.

1013
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,000
Or they'll just leave,
for hours.

1014
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,999
This year we have eighteen cubs.

1015
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:38,042
Eighteen cubs.

1016
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,959
I had a bear come here so
sick, about a three year old

1017
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:43,626
and it was just about dead.

1018
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:44,417
But I already knew what to do

1019
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,626
because I realize it was
anti-freeze poisoning.

1020
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,709
I had learned from a guy
when the first cub arrived

1021
00:58:48,709 --> 00:58:51,918
and he told me, I was
just starting this.

1022
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:54,667
I was only the second year, I
was just still throwing food.

1023
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:57,042
And he said well, it sounds like
anti-freeze poisoning to me.

1024
00:58:57,042 --> 00:59:02,375
Get some raw eggs,
cook up some...

1025
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,709
some oat...

1026
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,999
some oatmeal, and
put cream in it.

1027
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:09,876
All the rich stuff you
can get, then separate it

1028
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:11,918
from its mother,
and give it to it.

1029
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:12,999
And I said, "I'll
get right on that.

1030
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:14,501
What do you mean separate
the cub from its mother?

1031
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:16,667
You nuts?"

1032
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:18,667
Well I did manage
to pull it off.

1033
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:19,999
I kept the mom and the two
eating cubs busy and then I went

1034
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:23,334
over and gave the pot, and
he ate the whole thing.

1035
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:26,125
The next day he didn't show
up and I thought he'd gone,

1036
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:28,334
but the next day he came
and he's one of our bears.

1037
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:32,209
In fact he's the bear
we call Big John.

1038
00:59:32,209 --> 00:59:35,792
Yeah, Charlie came here,
he's been with us four years.

1039
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:41,167
I'm guessing he's
about seven or eight.

1040
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,792
Last summer he arrived
with a gunshot wound.

1041
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:47,209
I talked to some people
about that and they said

1042
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,876
that there are guys around who
just love to gut-shoot bears

1043
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:54,876
and let them run off
and die whenever.

1044
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,292
They just gut-shoot
them just for the sake

1045
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,459
of it, for the fun of it.

1046
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:00,709
Obviously they didn't
hit any vital organs.

1047
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:04,000
He's pulled, he's made it.

1048
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,918
Eh, Charlie?

1049
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:07,999
Good boy! Now, this year
you can't see the entry

1050
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,999
would anymore.

1051
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:12,000
The hairs all grown over,
the skin's grown back

1052
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,125
because it's just a
small little hole.

1053
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:15,459
But that side was
a horrible mess.

1054
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:18,667
What? He's about six
hundred pounds, this boy.

1055
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:24,751
Hey, hey Smoke.

1056
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:26,250
There you go buddy.

1057
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,709
There you go, good boy.

1058
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:30,751
They're naturally grazers.

1059
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,999
I've got video of a
bear going around here

1060
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:34,584
in the spring just mowing
my lawn beautifully.

1061
01:00:34,584 --> 01:00:38,000
Then I started studying up on
bear and going back to Genesis

1062
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,584
and realized that when Father
had made them all everything was

1063
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:46,542
to be eating the grasses
and the herbs of the field.

1064
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:51,918
So, that means everything,
including us,

1065
01:00:51,918 --> 01:00:53,709
we're all vegetarians
when we start with.

1066
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:56,125
>> NARRATOR: Michael has a
special bond with his animals.

1067
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:59,292
But of all his animals,
few have touched him

1068
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:02,292
like a bald eagle
he named Skywalker.

1069
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,999
Although it's illegal to keep
a bald eagle in captivity,

1070
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:15,626
Native Americans are exempt.

1071
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:17,542
And so, when a local
Indian tribe found an eagle

1072
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:20,459
that had been shot, the
First Nations Police called

1073
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:23,167
to Michael for help.

1074
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,584
Michael began to care for the
injured animal and slowly,

1075
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:28,834
day by day, he nursed
the eagle to life.

1076
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:31,459
>> MICHAEL: I sat up here

1077
01:01:31,459 --> 01:01:34,083
until about midnight journaling
everything that happened,

1078
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,542
all of the details while
they were still fresh.

1079
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:39,209
>>July the 7, 2010

1080
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:41,083
>> In Memory of Skywalker,
the Eagle

1081
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:43,375
>> Ten thirty in the
morning I received a call

1082
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,999
from Sabaskon Reserve,
Nestor Falls, Ontario,

1083
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:47,334
that there was an
eagle with a bad wing,

1084
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:49,292
trapped in the fenced area of a
baseball diamond, would I come

1085
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:53,999
and take him to our sanctuary?

1086
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:55,999
I said I'd be there
as soon as possible.

1087
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:58,584
On the drive up, I
had already decided

1088
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,375
to call the eagle Skywalker.

1089
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,834
I was finished around 7 p.m.
and he was lying on his stomach,

1090
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:05,292
legs outback, and talons .

1091
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,999
. . talons clenched tight

1092
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:09,751
and only breathing every
ten to fifteen seconds.

1093
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:12,584
His whole body was limp.

Then I had no choice but to
leave him in the Father's hands,

1095
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:18,334
He had created him and was
well capable of restoring him

1096
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,417
if it was in His will and plan.

1097

I had done all I could do.

1098
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:25,584
The next morning I climbed
up the ladder and said,

1099
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:28,209
well Father lets see what you
have done and there he was.

1100
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:31,626
Perched on top of a cedar pole,
standing as proud as could be,

1101
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:35,667
just looking at me with
those piercing white eyes

1102
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,709
as if nothing had ever
happened or was wrong.

1103

I just rejoiced and thanked the
Father for this miracle and went

1104

to pat Skywalker on the
head and spoke to him

1105
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:45,999
for about five minutes.

1106
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:47,999
I was ecstatic and full of joy
for him because just hours ago,

1107
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:51,584
he would have been
considered clinically dead.

1108
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:54,167
By evening he was perched on
a board at the highest point

1109
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:56,751
in his cage, a feat only a
strong bird could climb to.

1110
01:02:56,751 --> 01:02:59,999
Skywalker would not
take any food on Monday,

1111
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,584
but he climbed everywhere
and seemed to take water.

1112

Tuesday morning no change,
did not accept any food,

on Skywalker and he was
lying on his stomach.

1116

and asked God, why?

1119
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:27,125
Why? Why? I petted his head as
I knelt by him and apologized

1120
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:32,375
that I had not done more,
and I wept over him.

1121
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:39,876
I was devastated and sobbed so
hard and so long that I was weak

1122

and barely able to
walk to my truck

1123

and drive the thirty
miles to town.

1124

At Wal-Mart I picked up a
replacement bottle of peroxide

for my neighbor and
while at the checkout,

where one of the ladies had
called me over to serve me,

1127
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:55,501
we got to talking
and I broke down.

1128
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:56,918
She told me that God
had promised never

1129
01:03:56,918 --> 01:04:01,999
to give me more than
I could bear.

1130
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:04,083
I thanked her for reminding
me of that scripture

1131
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:06,709
and while I was still crying,

1132
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,167
she came around and
gave me a hug.

1133
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:10,667
I got a warm caring hug
from a total stranger

1134
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:13,125
and I thanked my Father for her.

After arriving home
and unloading,

1136
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:17,999
I knelt beside Skywalker
again and stroking

1137
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:20,999
that gorgeous white head and
looking into his beautiful,

worship the Lamb."

1141

1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,616
SOLDIER 1: Move it on in. SOLDIER 2: Keep moving.

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,852
SOLDIER 1: Come on, keep moving. Get along in there.

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,387
Move it along.

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,322
SOLDIER 3: Come on, get moving.

5
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,824
Move in that truck. Come on, move it.

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,426
Faster.

7
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,833
Hey, where do you think you're going? Get in the truck.

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,835
SOLDIER 4: Come on, move. No talking.

9
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,170
Keep moving in there.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,406
Come on! Move it.

11
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,808
SOLDIER 5: Get in there. There we are.

12
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,810
Get in there.

13
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:05,265
NERZHIN ( narrating ): My number is BS1968314.

14
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,834
Who's been here before me?

15
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,636
And how many will come after me?

16
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,372
GUARD: BS1968314.

17
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,442
NERZHIN: Nerzhin, Gleb Vikentyevich.

18
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,744
Mathematician, engineer.

19
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,014
Nerzhin, Gleb Vikentyevich.

20
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,150
Captain, artillery. Red Army.

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,753
( mysterious theme playing )

22
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,636
( man singing in Russian )

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,354
( suspenseful theme playing )

24
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,672
WOMAN ( over PA ): Leningrad. Leningrad, booth number 3.

25
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,241
We have your call.

26
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,876
MAN 1: Hello? Tashkent.

27
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,078
Stop cutting us off.

28
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,915
What? Are you flying in tomorrow?

29
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,084
I can't hear. Tomorrow night!

30
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,286
MAN 2: Hey, citizen,

31
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,021
it's 3,000 kilometers to Tashkent.

32
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,255
Why don't you talk louder?

33
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,857
Bring a kilo of butter, will you?

34
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,060
There isn't any here in Moscow. Butter. Butter!

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,828
MAN 3: You're last in line, comrade.

36
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,097
WOMAN ( over PA ): --ready in booth number 18.

37
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,066
Eighteen.

38
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,901
MAN 2: I've been trying to get us on...

39
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,528
VOLODIN ( thinking ): Should I say anything or hang up?

40
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,463
What if the phone's tapped?

41
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,332
Hang up. Just hang up.

42
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,735
I can't, I'm not an animal. I have a conscience.

43
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,704
They can't tap all the phones in Moscow.

44
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,172
It's impossible.

45
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,907
Should I change my voice?

46
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,276
Is this Professor Dobronravov's house?

47
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,645
WOMAN ( over the phone ): Yes. Who shall I say is calling?

48
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,314
You don't know me. I wanna speak to the professor.

49
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,617
Just give me your name, please. Who's calling?

50
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,185
Is this the professor's wife?

51
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,020
I don't have to tell you who I am.

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,588
Who is this? What's going on?

53
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,990
Listen. Please, listen.

54
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,825
I have to warn him. He's in danger.

55
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,260
In danger? When he was in Paris recently,

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,630
he promised the French doctors he'd give them something.

57
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,065
Some kind of medicine. The formula for new medicine.

58
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,668
Do you understand? He mustn't do it. Tell him not to do it.

59
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,203
It could be used as provocation.

60
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,606
But-- Hello? Hello?

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,389
SECRETARY: Would you like tea, Innokenti Artemyevich?

62
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,590
No, thank you.

63
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,726
The vice minister has called twice.

64
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,628
He wants you to phone him at 4:00--

65
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,330
Fine. Put me through to him then.

66
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,833
I'm not to be disturbed now. I have work to do.

67
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,370
( door closes )

68
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,962
VOLODIN ( thinking ): What an awful coincidence.

69
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,597
Why did it have to be the same doctor

70
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,332
who saved Mother's life?

71
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,202
Maybe it won't do him any good to know anyway.

72
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,803
Why did I do it?

73
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,474
Stupid. Stupid.

74
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,109
And naive.

75
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,578
Oh, I must be mad.

76
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,447
Oh, God, why did I call?

77
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,949
I'll lose everything now.

78
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,851
Six years in the diplomatic corps.

79
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,352
Councilor of foreign affairs,

80
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,654
lieutenant in the foreign service.

81
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,289
I have the very best background.

82
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,525
Mother was a revolutionist in 1917.

83
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,027
My wife's father is state's prosecutor

84
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,930
and a general.

85
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,568
And I only found out about Dobronravov by mistake.

86
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,137
No.

87
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,506
No, it wasn't really a mistake.

88
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,341
When I started working to be sent to Paris,

89
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,409
I knew I'd be involved in these things.

90
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,979
They have to be sure of you to give you a job like that.

91
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,982
What's the matter with me?

92
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,886
You only live once. That was always my motto.

93
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,689
But Mother always said you have only one conscience.

94
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,192
Why did I call him?

95
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,961
What am I waiting for? The police to come for me?

96
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,897
( phone rings )

97
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,268
Yes?

98
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,803
Volodin speaking.

99
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,838
Yes, I'm listening, comrade vice minister.

100
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,807
Your transfer to the Paris embassy

101
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,176
is all settled, Volodin.

102
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:27,079
What I want to know is can you be ready in three or four days?

103
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,549
I understand the post in Paris must be filled immediately.

104
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,983
I'll be ready.

105
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,919
Fine. Then I'll send the confirmation around

106
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,720
for the minister's signature.

107
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,589
That's all, Volodin.

108
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,725
( phone rings )

109
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,894
I asked not to be disturbed.

110
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:46,199
SECRETARY: But it's your wife. Shouldn't I put her through?

111
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,868
Innokenti, Clara is here.

112
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,903
She came over especially to remind you

113
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,339
that Daddy's banquet's the day after tomorrow.

114
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,575
VOLODIN: What Clara? What are you talking about?

115
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:59,812
My sister Clara. Silly.

116
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,482
This is Dotty. Dotty.

117
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,517
Have you forgotten you have a wife?

118
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,320
Dotty, I'm really busy.

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,355
All right then,

120
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,957
Innokenti Artemyevich,

121
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,792
I summon you officially to the banquet

122
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,360
given in honor of your father-in-law

123
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,128
Major General Makarygin

124
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,064
DOTTY: On the occasion of his being awarded

125
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,498
his second Order of Lenin.

126
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,567
It is his wish

127
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,336
that his whole family be present,

128
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,772
including his son-in-law, Innokenti Artemyevich Volodin,

129
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,877
consulate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Period.

130
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,945
Bye-bye.

131
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,914
He's so hard to live with these days.

132
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,182
He just refuses to forget

133
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,017
about, you know, that officer and me.

134
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,652
Hmph.

135
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,236
To Stalin.

136
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,537
Bottoms up.

137
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,939
( upbeat theme playing )

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,612
( indistinct chattering )

139
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,983
I told you Father would drink a toast to Stalin's health.

140
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,451
to Stalin's health.

141
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,953
My giddy old father.

142
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,722
Do you think of Stalin when we're in bed together?

143
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,758
A visit to your bed is not on my agenda.

144
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,459
You're too hospitable.

145
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,029
Here, have a drink.

146
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,100
MALE GUEST: Comrade major general. We're celebrating

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,703
your second Order of Lenin here tonight.

148
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,672
Here's to your third.

149
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,241
To the whole Makarygin family.

150
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,277
I'll have to think that one over. Ha-ha-ha.

151
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,047
I can't say that I am completely satisfied

152
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,949
with all the members of my family.

153
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,684
My son-in-law here,

154
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,320
first lieutenant to the diplomatic service

155
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,789
and the future ambassador.

156
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,058
I can praise for his work.

157
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,760
And for knowing how to appreciate

158
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,563
the finer things in life.

159
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,931
He took my daughter.

160
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,900
But I don't see the results.

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,669
Where are the children? I want to know.

162
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,871
( laughing )

163
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,211
And then-- Then there is my other daughter, Clara.

164
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,447
She's got her engineering degree

165
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,915
and that's fine.

166
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,818
She's 24 years old and that's fine too.

167
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,987
But it's the same thing again.

168
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,822
Where's the husband?

169
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,791
Where are the children? I want to know.

170
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,528
We Makarygins are an old proletarian family.

171
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:33,866
Oh, go on about our proletarian family, Father.

172
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,003
You once worked in a factory for two years.

173
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,139
But for the last 30 years, you have been a prosecutor.

174
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,708
We went into exile and hard labor.

175
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,477
Saviors of mankind.

176
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,113
What do you mean "went into hard labor"?

177
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,315
They're still going.

178
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,317
( laughing )

179
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,286
( indistinct chattering )

180
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,023
MAKARYGIN: Must be the switch. Let's have some candles.

181
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,793
CLARA: You heard about the job?

182
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,629
It's the one I didn't want.

183
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,930
I begin Monday.

184
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,033
It was my own father who arranged the job.

185
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,135
Stop torturing yourself.

186
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,571
Every political system has its security machine.

187
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,774
Security machine.

188
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,475
WOMAN: Aah.

189
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,477
( indistinct chattering )

190
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,184
Why don't we stop fighting?

191
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,287
You yourself say we only live once.

192
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,389
And you didn't miss any of it, did you?

193
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,626
Didn't I always give you everything you wanted?

194
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,827
Not only me.

195
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,196
Oh, that's not fair.

196
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,332
I told you myself about that officer.

197
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,767
It was during the time,

198
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,104
and don't try to forget it, when you'd had enough of me.

199
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:49,508
Innokenti, we had six beautiful years together.

200
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,943
America,

201
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,412
and then Paris after the war. And those were years

202
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,648
when other people were separated from each other

203
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,850
and dying at the front. Innokenti.

204
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,353
Don't start that, like Daddy.

205
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,825
( siren wailing )

206
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,250
GUARD: Halt. Take front.

207
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,121
Comrade major, transport 3326.

208
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,193
Igorvorov, Pavol Ivanovich, mechanical engineer.

209
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,928
Yes.

210
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,198
Vacinavich. Nicolai Vacinavich,

211
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,234
construction engineer.

212
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,268
Yeah.

213
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,872
Vasioshanko, Nicolai Yuriyavich,

214
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,473
construction engineer.

215
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,209
Yes.

216
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,245
( indistinct chattering )

217
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,046
How much bread do you get here?

218
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,349
Fourteen ounces of white bread and black bread...

219
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,017
MAN 1: What do you mean?

220
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,253
On the table, it's fine. You want it, you take it.

221
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,787
You don't want it, you don't take it.

222
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,256
What else do you get?

223
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,291
Well, professors get one and a half ounces of butter.

224
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,560
Engineers get three-quarters of an ounce.

225
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,162
Professor, it's you.

226
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,364
My God, it's you.

227
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,700
Tomorrow, they won't drag me out into icy water?

228
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,004
One and a half ounces of butter?

229
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,706
The guards don't beat you?

230
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,276
You can shave?

231
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,612
Maybe I'm dreaming. It's paradise.

232
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,980
Not at all.

233
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,515
We're still in hell.

234
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,084
But you've been brought to its highest level.

235
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,987
In the Institute for Scientific Research number 3251

236
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,223
or Special Prison number 325.

237
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,092
You are in the first circle of hell. Remember Dante.

238
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,262
Lev Grigoryevich, you're too much of a poet.

239
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,464
You only have to read the newspapers.

240
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,100
There was an article. It has been shown

241
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,936
that better sheep are fed and looked after,

242
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,637
the higher the yield of wool.

243
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,940
We work 14 hours a day.

244
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,542
The directors of our institute

245
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,913
recognize the full meaning of your engineering degrees.

246
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,183
They represent hard work. Well done.

247
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,887
And another addition to our new Soviet intelligentsia.

248
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,124
Young patriots worthy of our confidence.

249
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,527
I congratulate you.

250
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,097
Major Shikin, our chief security officer here,

251
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,399
is responsible for the safety and order

252
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,535
of our institute.

253
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,570
If you please, major.

254
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,839
SHIKIN: We have taken over this old mansion

255
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,274
on the outskirts of Moscow.

256
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,909
It's been divided into two parts.

257
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,511
The prisoners are not allowed to cross that dividing line

258
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,779
without a special pass.

259
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,249
The prisoners sleep here, where the chapel was.

260
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,850
The laboratories are here.

261
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,685
Over here is the administration.

262
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,257
You may enter the laboratory only at designated times.

263
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,525
As officers of the Ministry of Security,

264
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,829
you'll receive the rank of lieutenant junior grade.

265
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,298
I want to impress upon you that your work here

266
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,600
is of the highest responsibility

267
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,236
and extremely dangerous.

268
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,572
The scientific and experimental research

269
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,540
conducted here under the direction

270
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,142
of Colonel Yakonov

271
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:13,212
is very important to our country.

272
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,048
You're all party members,

273
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,484
all members of the Young Communist League.

274
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,254
But if, due to inexperience,

275
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,257
one of you should fail to observe the rules,

276
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,594
even in the smallest detail, for instance,

277
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,930
lending a book to a prisoner,

278
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,532
you will be discharged.

279
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,602
I may add that any liaison of any kind with a prisoner

280
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,472
will be punished under the criminal code

281
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,410
with up to 25 years of hard labor.

282
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,751
YAKONOV: This is Nerzhin, engineer.

283
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,220
Bulatov.

284
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,990
Bobynin, engineer.

285
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,559
Rubin.

286
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,063
And our eminent Professor Chelnov.

287
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,133
Adamson. Comrade Adamson.

288
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,802
Here, sir.

289
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,907
Dr. Rubin and Bulatov will explain the nature

290
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,309
of our experiments.

291
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,479
And your place is over there.

292
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,381
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

293
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,484
Comrade Yakonov, thank you.

294
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,252
Good luck.

295
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,327
( clanging and whirring )

296
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,578
Yes. Yes, Comrade Shikin.

297
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,746
Yes, I understand.

298
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,915
Prisoner Doronin will report Thursday.

299
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,051
Yes, everything's fine.

300
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,452
Really, they behave very well

301
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,921
for criminals and saboteurs.

302
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,157
Of course. Yes.

303
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,460
He'll report on Thursday.

304
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,296
Doronin.

305
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,766
Prisoner Doronin!

306
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,703
Doronin!

307
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,309
Aah! How dare you?

308
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,311
You have to watch your step here, citizen engineer.

309
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,813
You have a nerve.

310
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,450
Major Shikin warned me about prisoners like you.

311
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,222
I've already got 25 years.

312
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,058
Call Major Shikin.

313
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,126
I'll tell you what to say.

314
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,128
"Please tell me if socialist justice

315
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,097
will change after Stalin's death."

316
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,733
And he'll answer, "In principle, yes.

317
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,034
"Execution of the accused

318
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,805
before the verdict's given will not be allowed."

319
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,710
You just say that to Shikin.

320
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,579
Go ahead.

321
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,782
How old are you? Twenty-three.

322
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,452
And you've got 25 years? What for?

323
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,387
Nothing.

324
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,656
For nothing, you get five years.

325
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,459
So you must have done something.

326
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,329
Why?

327
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,533
Why did you lift me up like that?

328
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,903
Because I haven't had anything like you in my hands

329
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,705
for years.

330
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,142
( buzzing )

331
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,348
What is it, Doronin?

332
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,350
You sent for me, major?

333
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,153
Can't you wait?

334
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,861
Before you were convicted, you were a party member.

335
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,163
I've never stopped being a communist.

336
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,664
So I've heard.

337
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,367
You said that in front of the other prisoners.

338
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,336
Since you hear everything anyway, citizen major,

339
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,704
why ask me?

340
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,939
Now, listen, Rubin. That's my party duty.

341
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,609
You ought to know that. We have to know

342
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,345
what the prisoners are saying and thinking.

343
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,213
It's state security.

344
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:13,118
And if you're pro-Soviet, then you'll help me.

345
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:18,123
If you're not pro-Soviet than you're an anti-Soviet.

346
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,926
How do you want me to write the denunciations?

347
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,461
In ink or pencil?

348
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,998
Well, ink would be better.

349
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,268
I've already proved my devotion to Soviet authority in blood.

350
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,903
I don't need to do it in ink.

351
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,540
You must help us, Doronin. We must know everything.

352
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,875
Everything there is to know about the prisoners.

353
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:42,614
And we know more about you than you know yourself.

354
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,417
( romantic theme playing )

355
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,259
I'm not going to fool around with you.

356
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,895
You wanna go back to Siberia?

357
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,469
Do you pay for this work, citizen major?

358
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,138
Hundred-and-fifty rubles a quarter.

359
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,739
But don't worry, it'll be in the form

360
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,075
of a money order from your family outside.

361
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,778
From an uncle, say.

362
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,950
Couldn't it be from a woman?

363
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,351
That's always nice.

364
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,553
A hundred-and-fifty rubles from a woman.

365
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,255
( Shikin chuckles )

366
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,090
Actually, you'll get 147 rubles

367
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,961
because the post office deducts 3 rubles for sending it.

368
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,998
I had just finished school when they arrested me.

369
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,500
Because I went fishing twice with some Americans

370
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,370
who rented a summer house in the village next to ours.

371
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,138
( chuckles )

372
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,374
I was green then.

373
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,809
They tried to make say

374
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:48,413
that I'd received instructions from the CIA.

375
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,616
I just cried all the time.

376
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,585
Then, suddenly, they let me go.

377
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,154
I knew they would get me sooner or later.

378
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,224
They let me go so they could keep a watch on me.

379
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,860
I couldn't take that, so I ran.

380
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,830
I changed my name, forged my identity card.

381
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,567
I was in Uzbekistan and the Crimea for two years.

382
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,503
Then finally they got me,

383
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,006
when I tried to get into the university.

384
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,340
Doronin, you see,

385
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,143
you really did want to be a good citizen.

386
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,779
Call me Ruska.

387
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,849
They sent me to Siberia, to the mines.

388
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,351
I worked in the water right up to my waist.

389
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,286
But I got out.

390
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,522
Those bastards.

391
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,124
Oh, excuse me.

392
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,793
They teach us such nice things in school,

393
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,528
and then right after, everything,

394
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,764
every other word is son of a bitch.

395
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,400
But to be such an outcast...

396
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,601
Was I?

397
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,603
You've been to Tashkent,

398
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,338
to the Tezik bazaar.

399
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,839
Who's running it now?

400
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,841
Who's got the money there?

401
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,311
You can buy authentic war medals

402
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,147
with blank citation certificates.

403
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,582
For money, you can get anything there.

404
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,317
But you can't make that kind of money

405
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,687
by doing an honest day's work.

406
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,956
Yes, I saw it too.

407
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,061
( romantic theme playing )

408
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,408
Who sentenced you?

409
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,477
Which prosecutor?

410
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,680
DORONIN: I don't know. Why do you ask?

411
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,484
My father's a state prosecutor.

412
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,686
( alarm ringing )

413
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,506
A toast to Nerzhin, 31 years old.

414
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,242
Not bad.

415
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,444
( explosion )

416
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,716
( Vladimir laughs )

417
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,752
Salute to Stalin.

418
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,054
A birthday celebration.

419
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,623
How many years did he take from you, Gleb Vikentyevich?

420
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,558
What's the difference, Vladimir Ivonavich?

421
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,960
Better not to think about it.

422
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,328
Not enough vodka.

423
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,829
All right.

424
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,232
I propose the next toast.

425
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,833
To the 15 million

426
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,402
distinguished citizens of the Soviet Union.

427
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,738
Here's looking at you, Gleb. It's your day.

428
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,908
Which 15 million distinguished citizens, Vladimir Ivonavich?

429
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,578
Why, those 15 million that the father of our country

430
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,782
and all of progressive mankind have sent to rot

431
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,684
in Siberia and camps in Latyga.

432
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:43,388
And in the Institute for Scientific Research,

433
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,890
Lev Grigoryevich.

434
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,725
Here's to you, Vladimir Ivanovich,

435
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,126
but we're disposable.

436
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,295
Our screwed up lives won't change

437
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,596
the historical evolution.

438
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,665
Stalin knew this development would have--

439
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,767
Ruska, I'll strangle you with my bare hands

440
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,335
if you don't come off it.

441
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:01,306
Today on Gleb's birthday, that bullshit contamination.

442
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,707
Who are you trying to kid?

443
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,910
That's not what you learn here in prison

444
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,412
from your own buddies, historical biographies.

445
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,347
PRISONER: For Christ's sake, let's drink.

446
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,650
The night guard could come barging in here any minute

447
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,851
and we'd lose the vodka

448
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,486
that we risked our pretty necks for.

449
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,821
Here's to all of us.

450
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,056
To the brilliant defender of the wronged

451
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:22,994
and downtrodden in the camp of world imperialism.

452
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,697
To the brilliant teacher

453
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,867
and wise councilor to all the races.

454
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,836
Colors of the world.

455
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,637
To the son and hope,

456
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,106
to our revered fellow countryman,

457
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:39,878
our dearly beloved Comrade Stalin.

458
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,114
( glass breaks )

459
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,017
Listen, I'm just the same as the rest of you.

460
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,652
Caught in the roundup of 45 hours.

461
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,054
I was four years at the front.

462
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,656
Got a big chunk of shrapnel in my side

463
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,625
and a five-year prison sentence.

464
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:57,195
But don't let my own troubles change my perspective.

465
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,065
Stalin is a rogue spear and Napoleon of the revolution.

466
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,034
He sees ahead. He sees the end.

467
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,336
The end?

468
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,339
The end justifies the means, is that what you mean?

469
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,374
That's one of the dirtiest tricks of all.

470
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,842
It's just the opposite.

471
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,612
Dishonest means destroy the ends themselves.

472
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,213
And who beat Hitler?

473
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,349
Stalin? Yeah.

474
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,784
Hitler was the only person he believed in.

475
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,152
He didn't believe in anybody else,

476
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,954
not even Churchill, only Hitler.

477
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,756
It cost us 20 million people.

478
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,058
Gleb Vikentyevich, there's a rumor

479
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,262
that you've got a copy of Yesenin's poems. Lend it to me.

480
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,297
Damn it, you can't keep anything quiet around here.

481
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,133
I'll loan it to you. Only don't go yet, Adamson.

482
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,534
Why not?

483
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,838
I've been in 15 years, and it's always the same.

484
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,107
I know what Rubin's going to say.

485
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,575
The great idea.

486
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,210
Ten years ago, there were already camps

487
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,778
and they were living off the people

488
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,980
and tearing them apart for the great idea.

489
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,350
When I won't be here anymore, or Stalin either,

490
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,185
they'll get a new brilliant defender

491
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,387
of progressive mankind.

492
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,822
We've got a piece of land in Siberia.

493
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,090
The size of France.

494
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,359
And you know what it's peopled with?

495
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,894
Slave camps.

496
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,364
Pretty soon they'll need a hunt the size of all Europe.

497
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,099
For what?

498
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,435
The great idea.

499
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,003
It's a goddamned whorehouse.

500
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,939
No, it's a whorehouse on fire.

501
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,942
PRISONER: No, during a flood, there's a fire in the whorehouse.

502
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,544
No, it's a whorehouse on fire during a flood,

503
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:20,979
and there's just been an earthquake.

504
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,715
Cost is just too damn high, buddy.

505
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,117
Gleb, lend me the Yesenin book.

506
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,354
Give me a woman.

507
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:34,359
That's the biggest screwing we got from Stalin.

508
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,064
No woman for 25 years.

509
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,566
Can anybody know what it's like

510
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,202
to be without a woman?

511
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,708
I want to make love.

512
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,911
Give me a woman.

513
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,246
( thinking ) Give me back my wife.

514
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,783
We'd get together with our friends, read poetry.

515
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:02,320
Maybe it was Blok, maybe Yesenin.

516
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,889
We'd have long discussions about them,

517
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,826
about Russia, so deep within them,

518
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,528
about our lives.

519
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,831
Somebody squealed.

520
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,467
One of us was a squealer.

521
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,736
SOLDIER 1: All right, everybody. Stay where you are.

522
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,037
You're under arrest. get going.

523
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,305
SOLDIER 2: Let's go, let's go.

524
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,707
No, no, no, that's my husband.

525
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,876
That's my husband.

526
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,679
( suspenseful theme playing )

527
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,309
( wind whistling )

528
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,024
Here, have some vodka.

529
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,094
( glass breaks )

530
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,368
( whimpering )

531
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,039
( sobbing )

532
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,479
( groaning )

533
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,715
You don't know.

534
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,319
You don't know what it's like for a woman in a camp.

535
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,793
I can't sleep.

536
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,294
A woman.

537
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,096
A woman trembling in my arms.

538
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,865
Oh, God, I've got to have her.

539
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,766
Who? Clara.

540
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,236
Clara? The prosecutor's daughter?

541
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,770
Ruska, you're out of your mind.

542
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,974
I tell you, Nerzhin, I'll have her.

543
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,976
She can threaten to send me back to camp.

544
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:41,079
I told him I'd turn informer for her.

545
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,483
BULATOV: You won't do it. I lost my wife because of a squealer.

546
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,051
( Ruska groans )

547
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,757
You goddamn fool.

548
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,760
I wouldn't tell you if I was really going to squeal.

549
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,998
Gleb, I want her. I want her.

550
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,667
( thinking ) Nadya.

551
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,868
( explosion )

552
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,104
My Nadya.

553
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,707
When was the last time I saw you?

554
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,176
When?

555
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:15,013
MAN: Volga. Volga.

556
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,348
Kiev calling.

557
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,384
Kiev calling.

558
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,653
Come in, Volga.

559
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,955
Come in, Volga.

560
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,559
12396.

561
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,860
12396.

562
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,161
( explosion )

563
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,597
Come in, Volga.

564
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,499
Come in, Volga.

565
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,935
Kiev calling.

566
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,971
12396.

567
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,807
Come in, Volga.

568
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,644
Come in, Volga. Kiev calling.

569
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,513
Volga.

570
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,415
Volga.

571
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,417
( explosion )

572
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,129
Hey.

573
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,533
Is Captain Nerzhin here?

574
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,767
Why do you wanna know?

575
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,803
I'm his wife.

576
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,504
Oh, he's in the corner. Oh.

577
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,573
See, over there.

578
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,583
Oh. Oh, Gleb.

579
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,855
It's me. It's me. Gleb.

580
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,024
( gasps )

581
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,225
NADYA: Aah.

582
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,627
GLEB: Nadya.

583
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,428
( explosion )

584
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,751
How did you make your way up here to us?

585
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,088
First, I thumbed my way on trucks, then I walked.

586
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,624
MAN: You mean you came right through the front lines that way?

587
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,860
And you weren't afraid of the Germans?

588
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,061
Did they fire at you?

589
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,030
NADYA: Oh, yes.

590
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,032
MAN: Gleb. What?

591
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,634
Is that really a woman?

592
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,202
GLEB: I swear it.

593
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,190
MAN: Ivan. Ivan.

594
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,658
Ivan, look at him.

595
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,460
I think he stopped breathing. He's dead.

596
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,562
IVAN: What was he supposed to do?

597
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,632
MAN: He was alive a minute ago. What are we going to do?

598
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,468
IVAN: Nothing. You can pray.

599
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,370
MAN: The Lord have mercy.

600
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,839
The Lord have mercy on our souls.

601
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,207
On those of us are here

602
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,976
and on those of us who have gone beyond.

603
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,678
Accept the prayers of your servant.

604
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,780
Is he dead?

605
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,183
He's been dying all day.

606
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,220
We can't evacuate the wounded.

607
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,690
There's no letup in the firing.

608
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,794
Oh, it's a miracle you got through.

609
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,831
Gleb.

610
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,334
What is it, sweetheart?

611
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,904
They told us we were so well-prepared,

612
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,040
that we were so strong.

613
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,742
Stalin?

614
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,779
We weren't at all prepared.

615
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,081
It was a massacre.

616
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,218
Oh, Nadya. Oh.

617
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,159
( explosion )

618
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,762
( indistinct chattering )

619
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,632
NADYA: Oh, Gleb!

620
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,634
Be careful, Nadya!

621
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,835
Gleb!

622
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,036
( gunfire )

623
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,305
Gleb!

624
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,776
( gunfire )

625
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,880
Gleb!

626
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,548
Gleb!

627
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:25,062
GLEB ( narrating ): For four years, I fought in the front lines.

628
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:28,933
I even got a citation.

629
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,903
But they got hold of a letter I wrote to Nadya.

630
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:35,239
I wrote about Stalin and what was going on,

631
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,642
and what I thought of it.

632
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,746
So I didn't get to march in Red Square

633
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,683
in the triumphal parade when the war was over.

634
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,087
They marched me to the north instead.

635
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,389
To the far north.

636
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,790
SOLDIER: March.

637
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,592
( dogs barking )

638
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,567
SOLDIER: March.

639
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,337
March. March!

640
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,873
( dogs barking )

641
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,074
NADYA: Gleb.

642
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,642
SOLDIER: March. March!

643
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,611
Nadya!

644
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,846
Nadya!

645
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,047
SOLDIER: Come on.

646
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,250
( dogs barking )

647
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,486
Gleb!

648
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,820
Ugh.

649
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,155
Nadya.

650
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,757
( dogs barking )

651
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,663
I'll wait for you. I won't leave you.

652
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,065
SOLDIER 1: Keep moving out.

653
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,534
Gleb. SOLDIER 2: Come on.

654
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,238
I won't leave you.

655
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,906
( sobbing )

656
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:48,012
I wrote her not to wait for me.

657
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,313
( chuckles )

658
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,349
They don't understand on the outside.

659
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,918
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

660
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,353
This is the last of it.

661
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,522
In fine birthday tradition,

662
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,257
we'll drink to your health, Glebvichka.

663
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,525
Let's drink to those

664
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,660
who have bound themselves to our lives.

665
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,030
We have no choice, so they are the real heroes.

666
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,932
To our wives.

667
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,470
( melancholic theme playing )

668
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,243
I think it's snowing outside.

669
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,020
GLEB ( narrating ): Colonel Yakonov was in charge of our work on a device

670
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,956
known as the absolute encoder. According to plan...

671
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,891
GLEB ( narrating ): A telephone ordered by Stalin

672
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,260
that would be impossible to tap.

673
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,095
Tap-proof.

674
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,431
I made a breakthrough on the design

675
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,999
and felt certain that it put me

676
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,101
far ahead of the others. All the experiments...

677
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,970
GLEB ( narrating ): However, I kept it secret,

678
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,906
since I was working for my freedom.

679
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,741
Only Professor Chelnov could tell me

680
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,712
whether I was really on the right track.

681
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,781
Professor Chelnov, please excuse me.

682
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,584
But have you had time to study my drawings?

683
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,787
Let's go to your board.

684
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:04,989
SOLDIER: Show your passes.

685
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,859
SOLDIER: All right.

686
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,069
Very good.

687
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:22,406
I think you have finally got the absolute encoder.

688
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,910
And the telephone line can be used by Stalin

689
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,814
with the utmost trust anywhere in the Soviet Union.

690
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,551
And you can begin a new life outside.

691
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,553
( thinking ) And the old one?

692
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,788
Is it finished?

693
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,729
NERZHIN: Ugh.

694
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,570
Ugh.

695
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:14,025
GLEB ( narrating ): They can only really be sure of you when you're dead,

696
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,528
so they bash your skull with a mallet.

697
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,764
Just to be sure.

698
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,536
( mallet bangs ) ( man groans )

699
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,505
GUARD: This one's still alive.

700
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,839
Lucky bastard.

701
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,076
Of course, you still have a way to go,

702
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:35,479
but your construction design is unparalleled

703
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,416
by any of the other engineers.

704
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,851
It will bring you freedom, a clean slate

705
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,921
and an apartment in Moscow.

706
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,023
And how are they going to use this machine?

707
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,259
And who is it for?

708
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,394
It's up to us.

709
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,231
Have they finished their production conference

710
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,167
( over the intercom ) in there or not?

711
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,437
GLEB: Don't you have any moral objections?

712
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,053
What were you talking about with Chelnov?

713
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:20,291
About our work, according to regulations.

714
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,060
I am the head of this laboratory.

715
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,263
I want to know exactly about what you were speaking.

716
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,433
I'm sure you're informed about the work we do.

717
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,002
What were the moral objections

718
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,105
you were talking about with prisoner Chelnov?

719
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,340
Professor Chelnov.

720
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,975
There are only prisoners here.

721
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,479
There are Russian scientists here.

722
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,281
Please, answer.

723
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,716
What moral objections

724
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,385
were you talking about with prisoner Chelnov?

725
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,854
Prisoner Chelnov has degrees

726
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,289
from the Sorbonne, Cambridge and Yale.

727
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,159
He was personally acquainted with Einstein and the pope

728
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,595
before it was his great pleasure to meet you

729
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:01,365
and all the other officers of the NKGB.

730
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,734
That will do.

731
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,970
Please show me those drawings.

732
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,739
You can see them for yourself.

733
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,176
Show them to me immediately.

734
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,978
Look at them yourself.

735
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,314
Prisoner Nerzhin asks permission

736
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,151
to return to Colonel Yakonov's meeting.

737
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,225
MAN: We've tuned it up to clear it at every 16th impulse

738
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,996
and it's much better, citizen colonel.

739
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,636
It seems as though the reception is better.

740
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,304
However, let Rubin listen.

741
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,539
He has a good ear.

742
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,174
Stupidity.

743
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,342
One step forward and two steps back.

744
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,612
There's no point in feeling it out by guesswork.

745
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,914
You have to have a method.

746
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,450
I must remind you that according to plan,

747
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,818
the main circuit of the encoder

748
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,020
was to be ready by the end of the month.

749
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,688
I don't think we are there yet.

750
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,924
We'll have to work Sundays.

751
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,060
Yes. Yes, of course. That would give us an extra--

752
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,361
( phone rings )

753
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,097
Hello. Yakonov speaking.

754
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,234
Yes, sir.

755
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,969
I'll be in comrade minister's office

756
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,072
at 12 midnight. Yes, sir.

757
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,475
He has arrived, Deputy Minister Sevastyanov,

758
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,344
Head of the Special Equipment Section,

759
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,879
Major General Oskolupov.

760
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,249
Chief Engineer, Colonel Yakonov passed through.

761
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,185
The minister is in Comrade Stalin's office.

762
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,854
You may be seated.

763
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,140
Will Comrade Stalin see me tonight?

764
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,209
I don't know. You'll have to wait.

765
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,646
( buzzing )

766
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,149
Josif Visarionovic.

767
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,785
You have a Abakumov down for 1:00.

768
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,621
Will you receive him?

769
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,723
We'll see. I don't know.

770
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,291
Well, he can wait.

771
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,794
These two new biographies have been sent over.

772
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,731
Are five million copies enough? Not too few?

773
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,900
Is it interesting? Have you read them?

774
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,670
Oh, yes, most interesting. It's all based on fact.

775
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,640
"His strategic genius, his wise foresight,

776
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,241
"his powerful will.

777
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,877
"It was our great good fortune that in the difficult days

778
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,513
of the Great War, we were led by Stalin."

779
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:31,382
That's right. That's right.

780
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,651
And I have Tito's biography here.

781
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,985
Read it.

782
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,322
"Hopeless blockhead, perfidious evil tyrant,

783
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,690
cowardly traitor..."

784
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,725
Give it to me.

785
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,030
Disgraceful. How can you trust people like that?

786
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,665
You have to be more careful.

787
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,073
He wants to know about the secret telephone.

788
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,244
Your briefcase, please.

789
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,918
( buzzing )

790
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:16,427
Good evening, Josif Visarionovic.

791
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,628
May I come in?

792
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,730
Well, what is it?

793
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,870
Now, what was it I was going to ask you?

794
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,541
Now I can't remember.

795
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,309
You can go.

796
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,047
( buzzing )

797
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,224
( door closes )

798
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,226
( footsteps )

799
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,898
MAN: You may be seated.

800
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,602
Well, when will the secret telephone be ready?

801
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,304
You keep stringing me along.

802
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,973
August the 1st, the November celebrations.

803
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,609
Then for New Year's Day. Well?

804
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,012
Comrade minister,

805
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,180
Comrade's Major General Colonel,

806
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,549
let me assure you that we will spare no effort--

807
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:15,686
I'm asking you what date.

808
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:16,987
Comrade minister,

809
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:20,190
in the frequency range up to 2,400 cycles,

810
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,394
given an average transmission level of 0.9--

811
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,763
Cycles, cycles. I want the telephone.

812
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,097
Two complete units.

813
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,899
When can I have it? Well?

814
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,968
Please, let me know what you have in mind,

815
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,803
Viktor Semyonovich.

816
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,171
Two way conversations

817
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,573
and we still don't have absolute encoding?

818
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:40,310
Why are you trying to make an idiot out of me?

819
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,380
What do you mean don't have absolute encoding?

820
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,986
Another month.

821
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,555
Just one more month.

822
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,424
Until the 1st of February.

823
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:57,227
All right. Make it the anniversary of Lenin's death.

824
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,631
Do it and you will all receive a Stalin prize.

825
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,634
Sevastyanov, will it be ready?

826
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,403
Yes, it will.

827
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,839
Oskolupov, I'll have your neck.

828
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,508
Will it be ready? Yes.

829
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,812
As for you. You know what you're risking.

830
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,213
Will it be ready?

831
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,714
One month.

832
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,616
The 1st of February.

833
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:22,786
Well, just remember, I didn't make you say it.

834
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,521
I can forgive anything.

835
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,524
But if you let me down in front of Comrade Stalin,

836
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,359
I won't forgive you.

837
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,128
You can go.

838
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,897
( phone ringing )

839
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,532
Abakumov.

840
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,968
Aah.

841
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,803
Abakumov.

842
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,906
Yes, Josif Visarionovic.

843
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,775
Comrade Stalin, I'm right here, sir.

844
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,443
STALIN: Listen, Abakumov.

845
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,779
You forgot to tell me about my secret telephone.

846
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,882
How long am I going to have to wait?

847
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,887
Oh, by the way, the death penalty,

848
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,123
we're going to give it back to you.

849
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,325
( alarm ringing )

850
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,796
Attention!

851
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,364
Bobynin, get up and get dressed.

852
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,267
What's the idea? It's the middle of the night.

853
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,769
Don't ask questions. Get up, Bobynin.

854
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,939
On the double.

855
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,510
GUARD: Vladimir Ivanovich Bobynin, comrade minister.

856
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,581
You work with the group on the secret telephone.

857
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,951
Or technically, the absolute encoder, Bobynin.

858
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,687
BOBYNIN: Voice coder. Coded voice.

859
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,789
Sit down.

860
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,291
Thank you.

861
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,560
I want you to speak frankly without being afraid

862
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,897
of getting into trouble with your superiors.

863
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,100
When will the voice coder be ready?

864
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,937
Tell me the truth. In one month? Two?

865
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,939
A voice coder in a month?

866
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,375
Heh. You-- Ha-ha-ha.

867
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,812
You obviously don't understand anything about it at all.

868
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,613
It's very complex.

869
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,182
Uh-- Uh...

870
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,584
Do you have a piece of paper?

871
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,123
I'll try to explain it simply.

872
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,698
Prisoner Nerzhin, comrade minister.

873
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,233
Should I turn on the lights?

874
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,904
No. Just send him in.

875
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,142
( door closes )

876
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,249
NERZHIN: You sent for me?

877
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,395
( sneezes )

878
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,931
Why did you sit down without permission?

879
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:50,534
Well, there's an old Chinese proverb.

880
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,236
It's better to stand than to walk,

881
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,804
it's better to sit than to stand.

882
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,139
And best of all is to lie down.

883
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,009
Do you realize who I am?

884
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,111
No, who are you?

885
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,680
Someone like Marshall Goering?

886
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,317
Like who? Marshall Goering.

887
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,987
You don't see any difference between us?

888
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,657
Between you and him or between us?

889
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,160
Between us, I see it very clearly.

890
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,264
You need me and I don't need you.

891
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:21,665
Listen, prisoner,

892
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,934
I want to talk to you like a human being,

893
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,270
but don't forget yourself. I don't talk at all

894
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,605
unless I'm treated like a human being.

895
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:35,212
We can make you talk when we want to.

896
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,181
You are wrong, citizen minister.

897
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:41,184
I don't have anything.

898
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,589
Do you understand? Not a thing.

899
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,824
My family is dead.

900
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:51,828
You don't let me see my wife even once a year.

901
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,230
You took my freedom away long ago

902
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,564
and you can't return it to me

903
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,700
because you don't have it yourself.

904
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,136
I've already been in Siberia. I've been in chains.

905
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,204
You taught me to sit bare ass in the snow.

906
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,572
What else can you threaten me with?

907
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,741
What else can you take away from me?

908
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,411
My work as an engineer?

909
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,213
You'll lose more than I will.

910
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,349
I'm going to smoke.

911
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,620
Here. These are good.

912
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,789
Thanks, but I don't change brands.

913
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,490
Makes me cough.

914
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,061
Just understand one thing,

915
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,230
and pass it along to anyone at the top,

916
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,865
that you only have power

917
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:33,603
as long as you don't take everything away from people.

918
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:37,874
Because a person you've taken everything away from

919
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:40,177
isn't afraid anymore.

920
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,779
He's free again.

921
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,981
Engineer Nerzhin, I didn't call you in here

922
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,216
to get your views.

923
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,651
You're working on the voice coder.

924
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,154
Please tell me when it will be ready for use.

925
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,790
Well, there's something new.

926
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,460
Isn't there anybody higher than me you can ask?

927
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,230
I want to find out from you personally.

928
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,766
Will it be ready by February?

929
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,034
By February?

930
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,235
( chuckles )

931
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,537
You are joking.

932
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,206
Maybe next year.

933
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,042
Nerzhin, weigh your words carefully.

934
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,644
What can be done to hurry it up?

935
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,850
I don't know any way.

936
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,352
But why? Who is to blame?

937
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,254
I want to know. I don't care who it is.

938
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,224
I'll destroy him.

939
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,327
I'll send you off to the North Pole.

940
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,330
And as for you, Yakonov,

941
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,465
I'll put you in your special prison

942
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,234
as an inmate instead of chief.

943
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,869
And you can finish the voice coder

944
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,871
with your own two hands.

945
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,806
This is your last deadline.

946
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:47,277
The Lenin anniversary and not one day more.

947
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,881
Viktor Semyonovich, I have something else for them.

948
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,284
We're not going to keep paying them for nothing.

949
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,920
See if they can't identify the voice of a criminal

950
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,155
from a magnetic tape.

951
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,390
And if they can't, throw them out.

952
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,893
I'll take care of them, Mikhail Dmitrievich.

953
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,094
What are you talking about?

954
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:05,562
It's very simple really.

955
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,365
Some bastard, some pig, probably a diplomat,

956
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,566
telephoned the professor,

957
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,369
Professor Dobronravov I think it was,

958
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,271
and warned him not to give the French

959
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,706
some new medicine. The rat was giving it

960
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,842
on an exchange basis or something.

961
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,044
Actually, we wanted him to give it to them

962
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,412
so we could catch him in the act

963
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,115
and then make a big political case out of it.

964
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,350
Consorting with a foreign power.

965
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,020
We have the voice on tape of the sly,

966
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,389
miserable bastard who warned him.

967
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,758
I don't understand. How can you find a man

968
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,394
when all you have is his telephone voice?

969
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,262
Only five or six people in the ministry

970
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,730
could have known about it.

971
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,601
Well, arrest them all, the bastards. Six people.

972
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,837
We are a big country. They won't be missed.

973
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,674
We can't. It's the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

974
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,410
We have to find out exactly who did it

975
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,979
as quickly as possible.

976
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,850
Comrade minister, I think we can do it.

977
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,818
The other scientists who are working with me,

978
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:05,355
and I call it visible speech device.

979
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,857
Voice printer.

980
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,826
Every voice has its own individual visual pattern,

981
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:10,994
which can be recognized

982
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,663
even if the speaker disguises his voice.

983
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,599
This could become a new science.

984
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,936
Like fingerprinting. Voice printing.

985
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,672
Rubin, you're a prisoner,

986
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,142
but there was a time when you were a communist.

987
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,511
Maybe some day you'll be one again.

988
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,881
Our organization has confidence in you.

989
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:34,618
You're about to hear a state secret from this tape.

990
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,453
We have to find this bastard

991
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,355
who warned a traitor to our country.

992
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,756
You have the disguised voice--

993
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,358
Turn on the recorder there, please.

994
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,926
--of the criminal himself here.

995
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,629
And later, we'll put on the recorded voices

996
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,064
of six suspects who knew this state secret.

997
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:49,766
Sit down.

998
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,236
VOLODIN: Listen, please listen.

999
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,005
I have to warn him. He's in danger.

1000
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,240
WOMAN: In danger? When he was in Paris recently,

1001
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,609
he promised the French doctors he'd give them something.

1002
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,611
Some kind of medicine, a formula for a new medicine.

1003
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,213
Do you understand?

1004
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:04,881
He mustn't do it. Tell him not to do it.

1005
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,516
It could be used as provocation.

1006
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,486
WOMAN: But-- VOLODIN: Hello? Hello.

1007
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,290
May I hear the tape again, please?

1008
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,394
( tape rewinding )

1009
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,198
VOLODIN: Listen, please listen.

1010
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,000
I have to warn him. He's in danger.

1011
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,369
WOMAN: In danger? When he was in Paris recently,

1012
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,738
he promised the French doctors he'd give them something.

1013
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,941
Some kind of medicine, a formula for a new medicine.

1014
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,342
Do you understand?

1015
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,010
He mustn't do it. Tell him not to do it.

1016
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,645
It could be used as provocation.

1017
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,982
WOMAN: But-- VOLODIN: Hello? Hello.

1018
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,820
( thinking ) Heh. That's ridiculous.

1019
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,957
Why shouldn't the French have the medicine too?

1020
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,960
Medicine should cure, not ask your nationality.

1021
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,163
The man who warned the professor sounds all right.

1022
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,232
It took courage to do that.

1023
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:57,834
But what if making

1024
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,503
a scientific discovery's important?

1025
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,672
Necessary to the state?

1026
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,141
Then it was wrong.

1027
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,344
And his courageous act is harmful

1028
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,045
to the Soviet Union.

1029
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,647
Heh. God almighty,

1030
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,449
how disgusting they are, these generals.

1031
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,453
Guiltless pigs like them who put me away for nothing.

1032
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:20,624
God, how ironic.

1033
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:25,462
Still, they represent historical progress.

1034
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,964
VOLODIN: Is this Professor Dobronravov's house?

1035
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,267
WOMAN: Yes. Who shall I say is calling?

1036
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,702
VOLODIN: You don't know me. I wanna speak to the professor.

1037
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,038
WOMAN: Just give me your name, please. Who's calling?

1038
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,040
VOLODIN: Is this the professor's wife?

1039
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,842
WOMAN: I don't have to tell you who I am.

1040
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,276
Who is this? What's going on?

1041
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,678
VOLODIN: Listen, please listen.

1042
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,847
Give me time till tomorrow. I have to think.

1043
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,049
WOMAN: In danger? When he was in Paris recently,

1044
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,485
he promised the French doctors he'd give them something.

1045
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,053
Some kind of medicine...

1046
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,658
VOLODIN: What do you mean the minister's blocked it?

1047
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,893
I'm all set to leave.

1048
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,130
I'd like to speak to the minister, please.

1049
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,065
He's not in?

1050
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,870
( dialing )

1051
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,740
Volodin speaking. May I speak to the vice minister, please?

1052
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,543
Well, when will he be back?

1053
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,520
I'd like to speak to the department director, please.

1054
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,555
Yes, I'll wait.

1055
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:28,758
What's that? Just left the office?

1056
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,000
I'd like to speak to the supervisor, please.

1057
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,268
Volodin.

1058
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:42,138
Uh, hello? Hello?

1059
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,710
DOTTY: Believe me, Innokenti.

1060
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,246
We have only one life.

1061
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,549
We have only one conscience.

1062
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,085
What are you talking about, Inni?

1063
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,619
Did something happen?

1064
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,530
( thinking ) It's contemptible.

1065
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,099
Crazy.

1066
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,868
After what she had with someone else

1067
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,105
that I should want her so much.

1068
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:18,441
She'll suffer enough when I'm arrested.

1069
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,749
( slow theme playing )

1070
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,256
A056, comma 1,

1071
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:10,260
times 6 comma 7-- Six...

1072
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,961
Six.

1073
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:17,467
Six comma, 6...

1074
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,236
Six.

1075
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,438
Serafina Vitalyevna, could you help me in here?

1076
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:25,008
The microphone is dead.

1077
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,780
Six.

1078
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,860
A, A. No, it's not working.

1079
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,550
The door is open.

1080
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,490
It will be hard to say that we are satisfied

1081
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,757
with your behavior here.

1082
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,227
Citizen major, I observe the regulations.

1083
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,596
When do I see my wife?

1084
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,098
Tomorrow at 3.

1085
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:27,237
Tell me, prisoner Nerzhin, who's book is this?

1086
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,608
Oh, it's mine.

1087
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,977
Yesenin, collected poems.

1088
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,812
It's not forbidden.

1089
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:38,815
Only books published between 1917 and 1938

1090
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,650
are forbidden.

1091
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,319
For instance, what does this mean?

1092
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,621
"In earthly wedlock,

1093
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,557
I would join the pure white rose

1094
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,159
and the black, black toad."

1095
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,028
Oh, very simple.

1096
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,931
You shouldn't try to reconcile the white rose of truth

1097
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,600
with the black toad of evil.

1098
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,270
Did you call me in to discuss literature?

1099
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,939
Where did you get the book? Who gave it to you?

1100
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,376
Nobody gave it to me. I brought it with me from camp.

1101
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,512
I want it back. It's mine.

1102
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:13,883
You can forget about that visit from your wife, Nerzhin.

1103
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,235
Could you help me over here, Gleb Vikentyevich?

1104
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,153
It can't last long, Simochka.

1105
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:54,724
Shikin's after my neck. He wants to have me sent away.

1106
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,293
Sent away?! Where?

1107
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,896
What do you mean where?

1108
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,497
We come from the depths of hell

1109
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,967
and that's where we'll go if we have to go back. Camp.

1110
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,635
Oh.

1111
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,906
Back to the camp.

1112
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,641
What about your work?

1113
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,910
I don't understand?

1114
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,413
What will happen to the work you do?

1115
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:21,484
You know, by yourself? Please, you can trust me.

1116
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,386
I don't get what you mean.

1117
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,255
Oh, you get it all right, that I'm an officer

1118
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,757
and I'm supposed to be watching you

1119
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,158
and reporting on you.

1120
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,260
There's only one thing you don't get.

1121
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,231
And that's if someone had come in just a minute ago

1122
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:39,302
they'd have put you in solitary for 10 days, and nothing more.

1123
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,906
But I could have lost my job. They'd have put me in prison.

1124
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,943
Now, do you get it?

1125
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,980
You're marvelous.

1126
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,050
I'd like to take your body away with me.

1127
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,052
You know what used to upset me?

1128
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,887
That I don't have any children.

1129
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,691
And when I get out of here, that it will be too late.

1130
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:06,095
Funny, isn't it? I want to leave you with my child.

1131
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,731
I'll wait for you.

1132
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,166
When you get out, you'll come to me.

1133
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,835
You haven't anyone else? A wife.

1134
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,737
But you haven't been together for so many years.

1135
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,540
Eight. Is she still waiting for you?

1136
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,875
I told her not to.

1137
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,510
I could go back completely changed

1138
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,111
after 14 years in labor camps.

1139
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,013
I tried to get to see her just now,

1140
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,582
but I'm right up against Shikin.

1141
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:29,485
Please listen. You have to trust me.

1142
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:32,522
If anything happens I'll keep anything

1143
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,223
you want me to.

1144
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,461
( buzzing ) Is she very pretty?

1145
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:42,899
Let me go.

1146
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:48,604
Go ahead. You can check if you want.

1147
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,574
Rope, soap, hope.

1148
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,776
Please. Let go. Please.

1149
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,978
( continuous buzzing )

1150
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,514
Two plus two, shoot.

1151
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,882
Please.

1152
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,918
I won't let you go. I won't.

1153
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,486
Not now. Now, here.

1154
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:04,954
( buzzing )

1155
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:08,191
On Monday I'll be the only duty officer.

1156
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,394
I'll be alone then.

1157
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,395
What?

1158
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,964
We don't have any new dual tryout?

1159
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,066
Yes. Thank you.

1160
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:20,970
( alarm ringing )

1161
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:24,941
( indistinct chattering )

1162
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,412
( coughing )

1163
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:35,251
Gleb, I asked you for Yesenin. When can I have it?

1164
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,020
Haven't got it anymore.

1165
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,524
Someone stole it and turned me in to Shikin.

1166
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:45,428
Worst thing is they won't let me see Nadya.

1167
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,729
Again?

1168
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,132
She's in a very bad way.

1169
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,833
I tried to get a visit out of Shikin

1170
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,435
and got this business about the book.

1171
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,603
Who talked? Do you know?

1172
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,872
Stop yelling. You'll wake the whole place.

1173
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,340
How should I know?

1174
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,142
I tell you, we have to get the squealers.

1175
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,943
What squealers? How do you know who?

1176
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,246
Him. He said himself he was squealing.

1177
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,949
( indistinct chattering )

1178
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,951
PRISONER 1: Stop it. Stop it.

1179
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,920
PRISONER 2: What are you doing?

1180
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,122
( indistinct chattering )

1181
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,727
Kill the dirty squealer. Kill him.

1182
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,228
I didn't squeal on anybody.

1183
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,798
Who stole it? Nerzhin's book and gave it to Shikin?

1184
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,333
I saw it in Shikin's office right after Siromakha was there.

1185
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,369
He's lying, the bastard. You're crazy.

1186
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,204
Siromakha goes there all the time.

1187
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,107
All right, we'll believe him this time, but I'll get him.

1188
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,975
PRISONER: Can you prove it, Ruska?

1189
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,044
Siromakha sleeps in another cell.

1190
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,279
He almost never comes here.

1191
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,713
I'll prove it in black and white.

1192
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,081
How?

1193
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,018
Listen, an informer gets paid 150 rubles.

1194
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:43,986
They send it from outside so it looks better,

1195
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,155
but the post office takes out 3 rubles.

1196
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,192
So that makes 147 rubles that you get.

1197
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,626
Tomorrow it's mail day,

1198
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:56,566
and anyone who gets exactly 147 rubles,

1199
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:59,468
a country should recognize its squealers

1200
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,237
so that you'll recognize them.

1201
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:06,275
And you lousy Tatar, watch out.

1202
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,878
PRISONER: Did you get your money order?

1203
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,982
You know who it's from? Look.

1204
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,918
Claudia Kudratova. What a doll, eh?

1205
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,421
Who's had lunch? Is it worth going in?

1206
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,389
Yes, you got a lot, didn't you?

1207
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,059
You can buy your own lunch. What do you mean a lot?

1208
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,894
A thousand rubles.

1209
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,296
You can spit in our chow from now on, eh?

1210
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,632
What do you mean 1000? Look.

1211
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:31,634
147 rubles?

1212
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,737
Funny. Couldn't they make it an even 150?

1213
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,305
You pig! Squealer!

1214
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,541
What did you get it for and who did you sell out?

1215
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,142
You dirty bastard!

1216
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,844
PRISONER: Go to lunch. That was today.

1217
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,314
Idiot. We were just going to find out, that's all.

1218
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,519
Doronin has blown everything.

1219
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,154
He's going around telling everybody

1220
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,423
that whoever receives a check for 147 rubles

1221
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,092
is an informer for you, comrade major.

1222
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,894
Please, please, comrade major, cap me off.

1223
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:03,065
I'll pump 9 grams of lead into that son of a bitch.

1224
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,003
Doronin.

1225
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,540
Kalyakov sent for you. It's very urgent.

1226
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,542
Please go immediately.

1227
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,750
( whirring )

1228
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,552
Please, go immediately.

1229
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,102
Doronin. Kalyakov sent for me.

1230
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:41,537
There's been a phone call.

1231
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:45,174
You're to be taken to Major Shikin immediately.

1232
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:48,544
Prisoner Doronin reporting, citizen Major.

1233
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,220
Ugh.

1234
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,124
You bastard. Selling us out.

1235
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,026
Say goodbye to life, Judas.

1236
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,062
We'll shoot you like a dog.

1237
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,631
You'll never leave here alive.

1238
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,471
As for shooting,

1239
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,475
we'll see about that, citizen major.

1240
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,546
You just write down Ruska Doronin

1241
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,281
under my very nose,

1242
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:29,885
in my own prison, informed on all my squealers.

1243
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,887
Everybody's laughing at you

1244
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,524
and you're still picking up major's pay.

1245
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:38,294
I won't give up Nerzhin.

1246
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:43,733
Your prison is in position 134-4 plus 0.

1247
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,202
In our human labor supply program

1248
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,404
for the North Siberian Mine Plan.

1249
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,273
We have to have 20 prisoners from here.

1250
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:55,544
It only comes to 19 without this Nerzhin.

1251
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,613
This Nerzhin of yours is poisoning the morale.

1252
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,416
All you need is one rotten apple in the barrel.

1253
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,285
We've had several incidents already.

1254
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,659
It's the political atmosphere of the whole prison.

1255
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,129
We found a volume of Yesenin on him.

1256
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,663
Come, Yakonov, let's not overdo it.

1257
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,666
One more or less, you'll get along.

1258
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:21,337
No. Now, comrade, let's show a little flexibility

1259
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,206
in our bureaucratic decisions.

1260
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,510
As long as Comrade Yakonov has so decided.

1261
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,413
GUARD: Attention.

1262
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,181
Order of the day.

1263
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,849
On duty:

1264
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,885
Marcenko, Filipov.

1265
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:41,390
Now, Ivanov, Kovalov, Bobynin, Nerzhin, report downstairs.

1266
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,526
You have visitors today.

1267
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,227
The day before yesterday Shikin said

1268
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,531
it'd be a cold day in hell before I'd get a visitor.

1269
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,200
Something has to have happened. Something great.

1270
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,601
PRISONER 1: Something great?

1271
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,371
How about a beautiful funeral? Stalin's.

1272
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,840
No, we'd know his successor's name by now.

1273
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,176
When they lock us in here for the night, something--

1274
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,644
Anything could happen outside.

1275
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,779
Blood, fire, a Soviet could land on the moon.

1276
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:06,215
We wouldn't know anything about it shut up in our arc.

1277
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,616
If we were going to the moon first,

1278
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:08,851
they'd have to have a meeting,

1279
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,719
and everyone would take a production oath.

1280
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,688
PRISONER 2: There would be a report to Stalin

1281
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:15,057
and a rallying call to all the colored people's of the earth

1282
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:16,725
trampled by imperialists.

1283
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:19,195
CHELNOV: No, no, not at all. It won't be like that.

1284
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,930
Not at all. Don't worry.

1285
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,364
Why not?

1286
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:26,969
The Americans will get there first.

1287
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,537
BULATOV: Have you seen Doronin?

1288
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:32,775
Ruska? He wasn't here last night.

1289
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,912
That means he didn't come back from Shikin's office.

1290
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,614
Attention.

1291
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,517
You all know the rules. Give nothing to,

1292
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,652
and take nothing from your relatives.

1293
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,689
Don't talk about your work, don't mention any names.

1294
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,491
So, what do you talk about, politics?

1295
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,293
About your guilt and your repentance.

1296
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,295
You may not talk about your indictment.

1297
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,830
There's a new rule.

1298
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,399
From now on holding hands and kissing are forbidden.

1299
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,235
GUARD: Attention.

1300
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,504
Visiting time, 30 minutes.

1301
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,707
Give nothing to, and take nothing from the prisoners.

1302
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,575
You are forbidden to ask the prisoners

1303
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,944
about their work or about their life.

1304
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,646
There is a new rule.

1305
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,517
From now on holding hands and kissing are forbidden.

1306
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,318
If there is a violation,

1307
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,487
the visit will be terminated immediately.

1308
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,955
That's all.

1309
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:23,225
Kopolev, here.

1310
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,728
Lukashenko, third.

1311
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,698
Nerzhin, here.

1312
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,800
Bobynin, fifth.

1313
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,638
( door closes )

1314
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,545
( door opens )

1315
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,183
You may not touch.

1316
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:50,452
Sit down at the table.

1317
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,361
Nadya.

1318
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,264
Happy birthday, Gleb.

1319
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,833
I baked something for you.

1320
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,169
Silly, you shouldn't have.

1321
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,005
We have everything.

1322
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,475
I hope you like it.

1323
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,144
Do you still read Yesenin?

1324
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,246
Yes.

1325
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:20,249
You don't look well.

1326
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:22,551
You're so thin.

1327
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,687
Show me how you look.

1328
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,489
( melancholic theme playing )

1329
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,577
I'll bet you don't eat well.

1330
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,947
You don't like me anymore.

1331
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,416
I'm old.

1332
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,353
You're as wonderful as ever.

1333
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,421
It is your suit?

1334
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,856
For three hours.

1335
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,057
( chuckles )

1336
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,492
That's how it is.

1337
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,262
Obstacles everywhere.

1338
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:10,399
Are you still mine? Mine?

1339
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:15,237
I'm the one you loved.

1340
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,706
I'm no worse.

1341
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,942
How's your work going?

1342
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:23,445
They make it very difficult for me.

1343
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,481
What do you live on?

1344
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,684
I have a temporary job.

1345
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:33,222
No fixed pay, no apartment.

1346
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:36,291
Obstacles.

1347
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:38,994
Very difficult ones, my darling.

1348
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,463
I wanted to tell you,

1349
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:44,667
only don't take it too hard.

1350
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,937
You once tried to talk me into

1351
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,639
asking for divorce.

1352
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,308
( thinking ) Once yes, not now.

1353
01:11:53,308 --> 01:11:55,778
Yes, of course.

1354
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,946
You should have done it long ago.

1355
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:02,618
Would it upset you awfully if I had to do it?

1356
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:05,587
It wouldn't be serious.

1357
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,456
She's not wearing her wedding ring.

1358
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,392
What does it mean?

1359
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:14,029
You can't hope too much for the end of my term.

1360
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:17,066
It's conditional.

1361
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:21,804
I can't believe it.

1362
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,607
Do you really think that I want to leave you?

1363
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:27,676
No, no, Nadya, I believe you.

1364
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,312
( thinking ) He doesn't really need me.

1365
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,414
He was always so strong.

1366
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,383
Does he really need a faithful woman?

1367
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,218
Nadya.

1368
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,688
Don't be alarmed if they send me away for a while,

1369
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:43,125
and if I won't able to write.

1370
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,194
Can they?

1371
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,329
Where? God knows.

1372
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:51,300
Oh, don't tell me you're beginning to believe in God.

1373
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,868
Why not?

1374
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:56,371
Pascal, Newton, Einstein, they were believers.

1375
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:59,308
GUARD: You were told not to mention names.

1376
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,643
End of the visit.

1377
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,351
GUARD: What's going on?

1378
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,721
Do what's best for you, darling. Don't worry.

1379
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,124
GUARD: The visit's over!

1380
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:18,093
Go ahead, take her. To hell with you!

1381
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:24,433
Tell me something about yourself.

1382
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:27,336
I know things are hard for you.

1383
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,105
Alyosha, tell me.

1384
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:33,509
Do they let you out earlier for doing good work?

1385
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,778
No, dear.

1386
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,379
You have to invent something.

1387
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,948
Something special.

1388
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,650
Alyosha, please,

1389
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,653
invent something then.

1390
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:50,826
Well, the trouble is that the inventions are--

1391
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:54,897
Well, extremely undesirable.

1392
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,666
I only have three years more.

1393
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:03,138
Only three?

1394
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,974
For you it's only.

1395
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:09,278
For you it would be extremely undesirable

1396
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,447
to be free before your time.

1397
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,483
I've been fired from my job.

1398
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,618
I have nothing to live on.

1399
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:19,521
No one-- No one anywhere will give me work.

1400
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,858
My husband is an enemy of the people.

1401
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,762
I can't go through another month of it.

1402
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:30,199
Alyosha, I'm 37 now.

1403
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,468
In three years I'll be an old woman.

1404
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:35,537
Alyosha, my darling,

1405
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,706
my dearest, do something.

1406
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,141
Make them free you.

1407
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:42,144
You have a brilliant mind. Invent something.

1408
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:46,114
Alyosha, save me.

1409
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,951
Save me.

1410
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,520
( narrating ) My secret design for the encoder was ready.

1411
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,121
I knew it would work.

1412
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,691
Should I place it into their hands or into the fire?

1413
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,393
SIMOCHKA: How many sheets? Two? Please take it down.

1414
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,897
All waste must be reported.

1415
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,532
One.

1416
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,134
One.

1417
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,137
How many do you have?

1418
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,345
Serafina Vitalyevna,

1419
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,214
you look like you're dressed for a wedding.

1420
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,550
Six. Put it down.

1421
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:23,385
Well, since you are so very interested,

1422
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,788
I'm going to my uncle's birthday tonight.

1423
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,992
Two.

1424
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,894
How many, Gleb Vikentyevich.

1425
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,329
None. Thank you.

1426
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:44,139
169 used sheets of paper,

1427
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:46,742
officially burned.

1428
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:52,214
Hmm.

1429
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,683
WOMAN: Simochka, you're up early.

1430
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,653
Yes, I have to be at work at 7.

1431
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:03,358
Also, I'm on night duty tonight.

1432
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:07,362
Could you fry me some potatoes, Mama?

1433
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,798
WOMAN: I dreamed all night about that girl at work

1434
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,166
that you told me about.

1435
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,902
She's taking an awful chance.

1436
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,905
Uh, you know what?

1437
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:21,877
I think she really wants to have his child.

1438
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,680
But I'm sure she'll look after it

1439
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,517
and wait until he gets out.

1440
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:32,020
WOMAN: It's a terrible risk all the same.

1441
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,357
How can she give her virginity to a prisoner?

1442
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,658
( chuckles )

1443
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:41,229
Oh, Mama, you know how girls are now.

1444
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,967
For a while, their virginity is all that counts,

1445
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,035
but then it becomes a bore.

1446
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:21,069
Serafina Vitalyevna, here are a few more.

1447
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,104
Three.

1448
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,572
You don't need them?

1449
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,108
No, I don't. Put down three.

1450
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,909
OFFICER ( over the PA ): Nerzhin,

1451
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,646
report to Colonel Yakonov's office immediately.

1452
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,981
Please, sit down.

1453
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:38,720
Please, sit down, Gleb Vikentyevich.

1454
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,056
I'm glad to see you.

1455
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,825
Well, apparently you've prepared

1456
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,694
a pleasant surprise for us.

1457
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,195
Professor Chelnov tells me

1458
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,797
that he's looked over your drawings

1459
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:51,800
for the main section of the encoder.

1460
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,902
Why don't you sit down?

1461
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:57,272
I'm very anxious to see it in detail.

1462
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,007
You're wrong, Anton Nikolayevich.

1463
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:01,710
I worked on it for a while, but it didn't come off.

1464
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,980
Now, now, no false modesty.

1465
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,915
Chelnov is the best judge,

1466
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:09,051
and he gave it the highest praise.

1467
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,852
I'm going to give instructions

1468
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,687
that we are to be left alone now.

1469
01:18:12,687 --> 01:18:14,456
Go and get your drawing.

1470
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,558
Anton Nikolayevich, you've made a mistake.

1471
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,226
It's not worth looking at.

1472
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:19,828
Just a sketch.

1473
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:23,365
Well, we'll see. Go and get it.

1474
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,269
I don't have the sketch.

1475
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:31,306
I found irreparable mistakes in it and...

1476
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:32,774
I burned it.

1477
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,045
What do you mean?

1478
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,247
You burned it yourself?

1479
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:40,916
No, I turned it in to be burned.

1480
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,985
According to regulations.

1481
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,889
Then maybe it's still there.

1482
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,559
No, it's burned.

1483
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,794
I saw it.

1484
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:56,298
( sighs )

1485
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,511
Nerzhin,

1486
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:13,882
Chelnov told me your plan was the real thing.

1487
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:17,152
I've informed the Minister Abakumov

1488
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:21,990
that the secret telephone will be ready in a month.

1489
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,528
Come over here.

1490
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,702
Are you from Moscow?

1491
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,604
Yes.

1492
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,672
Look down there.

1493
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,908
Do you see the bus stop?

1494
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,478
It's half an hour on that bus

1495
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,248
to the center of Moscow.

1496
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:50,619
Nerzhin, you could be getting on that bus yourself next July.

1497
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:54,556
And in August, you'd be on holidays on the Black Sea.

1498
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,959
How many years since you went swimming, Nerzhin?

1499
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,961
Prisoners are never allowed that.

1500
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:03,064
We can, cutting timber.

1501
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:06,468
Oh, not where you're going to end up, Nerzhin.

1502
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,205
In the north, where the rivers never thaw.

1503
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:13,441
Listen, I can't believe there's anybody on Earth

1504
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,378
who doesn't wanna get the most out of life.

1505
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:22,551
Why did you burn your drawing?

1506
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:25,086
Why do you think?

1507
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:27,822
I don't know.

1508
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:30,091
I've heard that you were in prison for five years

1509
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,561
before you came back to this job.

1510
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,163
So I'll tell you.

1511
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:38,400
I don't want any part of this.

1512
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,606
I don't understand.

1513
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:48,410
It's suicide.

1514
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:05,627
( light switch clicks )

1515
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:10,465
We have to have a talk, Simochka.

1516
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,601
What's happened?

1517
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,203
I saw my wife yesterday.

1518
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:19,107
Why didn't you tell me that before?

1519
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,142
It happened suddenly, I didn't know.

1520
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:24,579
I hadn't seen her for two years.

1521
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:28,416
But now, when I saw her,

1522
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,752
I know I am still in love with her.

1523
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:33,388
Simochka, what can I do?

1524
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,991
She's given me her whole life.

1525
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,326
Who else would do that?

1526
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:41,396
Are you sure you could?

1527
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:44,099
Didn't she ever want to divorce you?

1528
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,368
Oh, well--

1529
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:49,971
No.

1530
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,974
Is she pretty?

1531
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:56,878
Yes. To me, yes.

1532
01:21:56,878 --> 01:22:01,716
Gleb, she won't wait for you.

1533
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,685
Not if she's pretty.

1534
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:07,722
If she's young and beautiful,

1535
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,992
she could have-- She may--

1536
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,862
She may live with other men.

1537
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:15,363
She won't wait.

1538
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:18,199
She's waited eight years.

1539
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:21,403
Of course, the last years will be the hardest.

1540
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,807
She won't wait.

1541
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,076
She doesn't have to.

1542
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,645
But I don't want to be the one...

1543
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:37,719
If one prison visit counts so very much,

1544
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,654
what can I do?

1545
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,625
( whimpers )

1546
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:00,575
( melancholic theme playing )

1547
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,454
No. Turn it on.

1548
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:15,757
( woman singing in Russian )

1549
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,230
Louder.

1550
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,485
Forgive me, Simochka.

1551
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,689
I'll get over it.

1552
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:54,229
You can still give me your work.

1553
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,564
I'll keep it for you.

1554
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:02,070
I already did. You burned it.

1555
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:19,788
Citizen general, we've narrowed it down to two.

1556
01:24:19,788 --> 01:24:21,289
Chevronik and Volodin.

1557
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,391
Please give us one more day at least.

1558
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,393
Please give us a chance to prove the identity

1559
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,128
of the guilty man beyond a doubt.

1560
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,730
We'll pick them both up.

1561
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,666
We'll put a microphone on the interrogation table.

1562
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:33,368
And you can hear their voices.

1563
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,103
But one of them is not guilty.

1564
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:37,071
What do you mean not guilty?

1565
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:39,207
Not guilty of anything at all?

1566
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,309
The Security Police will sort it all out.

1567
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,912
But-- What "but," Rubin?

1568
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:47,048
If you can arrest both of them, then why not all five?

1569
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,250
Why try at all?

1570
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,453
What are you trying to say, Rubin?

1571
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:54,389
Do you mean the other three are still in the picture?

1572
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:59,327
Well then, we'll pick up Chevronik and Volodin.

1573
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:04,599
( suspenseful theme playing )

1574
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,571
DOTTY: It's not for us.

1575
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,873
Somebody got the wrong apartment.

1576
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,107
Oh.

1577
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:15,543
Why are you so nervous, Inni?

1578
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:16,678
Oh.

1579
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,313
I wouldn't want any uninvited guests

1580
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,948
to spoil this evening.

1581
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:23,084
We haven't been to the theater together for so long.

1582
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:25,620
Are you expecting someone?

1583
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,590
( phone rings )

1584
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,325
You get it. I'm not here,

1585
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:33,328
and you don't know when I'll be in. Go on.

1586
01:25:39,067 --> 01:25:40,902
Hello?

1587
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,904
He's not home.

1588
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,572
Who?

1589
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,442
Oh. Good evening, comrade general.

1590
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:51,045
Yes, of course, I recognize you now.

1591
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,947
How nice of you.

1592
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,216
Just a minute, I heard the door. Maybe--

1593
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:56,618
Oh, yes, it is.

1594
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:59,954
Inni, come quickly, the general is on the phone.

1595
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,859
Hello, comrade general.

1596
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:07,161
Yes.

1597
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:09,230
Yes.

1598
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,765
Of course.

1599
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,268
By all means, comrade general.

1600
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,338
Everything's all right. I'm flying to Paris on Wednesday.

1601
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:18,540
The general's sending a car.

1602
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,108
There are a few details to go over.

1603
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,544
Don't you think maybe I could be one of those details?

1604
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,279
I want to go with you.

1605
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:25,513
I'll see what I can do.

1606
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,115
Now, get dressed. I'll be right back.

1607
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,550
We won't make the first act,

1608
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:30,552
but I don't think we'll miss much by it.

1609
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:34,322
Already? That was fast.

1610
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,366
I don't seem to remember you.

1611
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,268
Have you driven me before?

1612
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:48,736
Twice.

1613
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:52,840
I even remember your stairway, comrade councilor.

1614
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,615
( tires screeching )

1615
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:03,284
That's our mechanic from the garage.

1616
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,186
Ugh. It always gets stuck.

1617
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:09,190
Comrade councilor, could he possibly ride with you?

1618
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,359
You see, he's my boss.

1619
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,127
I really should pick him up.

1620
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:14,929
Of course.

1621
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,874
You don't mind?

1622
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,576
( coughs )

1623
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:32,880
You might open the window.

1624
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,750
Would you read this for me, comrade chief?

1625
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:39,387
I'll put a light on it for you.

1626
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:43,725
"Warrant for the arrest

1627
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:49,330
"of Volodin, Innokenti Artemyevich...

1628
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,033
"Volodin, Innokenti Artemyevich.

1629
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:54,602
Born 1919."

1630
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:57,305
Take it easy and don't move or I'll break your neck.

1631
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,041
Let go of me. Let me go.

1632
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,777
Driver, I hold you personally responsible for this.

1633
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:05,647
What sort of outrage is going on?

1634
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,352
Let me go!

1635
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,054
( Volodin groans )

1636
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,991
Get out.

1637
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:19,394
Hands behind your back.

1638
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:22,363
What are you doing? Shut up.

1639
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,566
Ah. Hands behind your back.

1640
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:34,275
My epaulettes. Hands behind your back.

1641
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:35,543
Take your handkerchief.

1642
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:38,079
After you've had your dirty hands on it?

1643
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:42,583
You'll get a receipt for your valuables.

1644
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:45,920
Get going.

1645
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:04,572
Keep moving.

1646
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,808
GUARD: Sleeping is not allowed.

1647
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:53,721
( mysterious theme playing )

1648
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,935
( coughing )

1649
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:19,914
Air!

1650
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,217
Open up. Open up, I'm suffocating!

1651
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:31,225
Why were you banging? I felt sick.

1652
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,494
Just remember, don't bang or you'll be punished.

1653
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,029
I don't feel well. Give me some water.

1654
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,664
Shouting is not allowed either.

1655
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,699
I don't feel well. I've gotta lie down.

1656
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,768
Sleeping is not allowed here in the box.

1657
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,570
Listen, call the lieutenant.

1658
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,038
Why am I arrested?

1659
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:50,278
Listen, lieutenant. What's the meaning of all this?

1660
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,546
It's a mistake.

1661
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,915
Show me the warrant for my arrest.

1662
01:30:53,915 --> 01:30:56,417
Name?

1663
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,120
Volodin. Latter name?

1664
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,688
Innokenti Artemyevich.

1665
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:01,889
Date of birth?

1666
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:04,292
Twenty-second of January, 1919.

1667
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,961
Place of birth? Leningrad.

1668
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,231
Hands behind your back. March.

1669
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:12,233
( alarm ringing )

1670
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,872
( indistinct chattering )

1671
01:31:20,775 --> 01:31:23,010
Stand at attention.

1672
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,489
Attention.

1673
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,757
You all know the order of the day.

1674
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:40,394
First, prisoners will be permitted to decorate a tree

1675
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:42,029
for the New Year.

1676
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:45,266
Next, the following will not report for work this morning,

1677
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:49,670
but will prepare for transport from this room:

1678
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,574
Kobarov, Mikalov, Bobynin,

1679
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:56,477
Bulatov, Nerzhin.

1680
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:57,912
That's all.

1681
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:00,715
( suspenseful theme playing )

1682
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:16,998
Listen, old boy,

1683
01:32:16,998 --> 01:32:20,001
for three years we haven't agreed once.

1684
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:24,438
We've argued all the time, ridiculed each other.

1685
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:28,910
But now that I'm losing you, maybe forever,

1686
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:33,281
I fear that you were one of my best friends.

1687
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:36,884
Thanks.

1688
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:47,662
Undress.

1689
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:49,864
VOLODIN: What for? Are you Russian?

1690
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:52,600
Why? Non-Russians don't have to?

1691
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,368
Undress.

1692
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,340
Throw it on the floor.

1693
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,811
Strip.

1694
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:05,246
What do you mean?

1695
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,082
If you don't, you'll be stripped by force.

1696
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:16,257
Let's see if you have anything hidden.

1697
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:18,059
Open your mouth.

1698
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,028
Wider.

1699
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:24,065
Lift your tongue.

1700
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,702
Turn around.

1701
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:31,639
Feet apart.

1702
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:34,241
On your heels.

1703
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,910
Again.

1704
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,080
Again.

1705
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,781
Get dressed.

1706
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:43,851
Strip naked.

1707
01:33:43,851 --> 01:33:45,052
But I'm just getting dressed.

1708
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:46,454
Why didn't they tell me to wait?

1709
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,155
Strip.

1710
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:51,792
Name, latter name, date of birth, place of birth.

1711
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:54,628
Have you got lice?

1712
01:33:54,628 --> 01:33:57,098
I'm a diplomat. So what?

1713
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,468
Have you had syphilis, gonorrhea,

1714
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,938
leprosy, tuberculosis?

1715
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,107
Anything else?

1716
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:13,280
Quickly. Why aren't you dressed yet?

1717
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,016
Sit down.

1718
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:27,862
This is it.

1719
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:31,265
The corpse died happily.

1720
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:34,735
And with a smile on his face.

1721
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,408
GUARD: Face the wall.

1722
01:35:14,408 --> 01:35:16,143
Don't move.

1723
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:25,986
OFFICER: Volodin?

1724
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:30,925
Innokenti Artemyevich, born 1919?

1725
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:33,594
Do you have so many Volodins?

1726
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:35,096
Could you get confused?

1727
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:37,865
Hands behind your back. March.

1728
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:52,813
Come on, get in there. Get inside.

1729
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,451
SOLDIER 1: Come on! Move it on in.

1730
01:35:57,451 --> 01:35:59,620
SOLDIER 2: Come on, keep moving.

1731
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,255
Move it along.

1732
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,890
SOLDIER 3: Come on, get moving.

1733
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,593
Move in that truck. Come on, move it.

1734
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,261
Faster.

1735
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:14,201
SOLDIER 4: Where do you think you're going? Get in!

1736
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,604
SOLDIER 3: Get in there. SOLDIER 5: Keep moving. Get in.

1737
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:17,805
SOLDIER 4: Move it along.

1738
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:20,040
SOLDIER 3: Come on, get moving.

1739
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,408
Move in that truck. Come on, move it.

1740
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,877
SOLDIER 6: All in the front.

1741
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:24,211
SOLDIER 3: Faster, move it. Come on.

1742
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:27,014
SOLDIER 7: Close it, close it.

1743
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,045
Now and again on the streets of Moscow,

1744
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,381
one sees food delivery vans.

1745
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:05,219
Clean, well-designed and hygienic.

1746
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:08,088
One must admit that the city's food supplies

1747
01:37:08,088 --> 01:37:12,026
are extremely well-organized.

1748
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,863
Brothers!

1749
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:19,934
I'm going to Butierki.

1750
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:23,170
For interrogation. Who's there?

1751
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,805
Who's being transported?

1752
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:27,474
Ruska! Nerzhin!

1753
01:37:27,474 --> 01:37:30,144
Bulatov! Bobynin!

1754
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:32,179
OFFICER: No talking during transport!

1755
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:34,782
Quiet, damn you! Fucking son of a bitch.

1756
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:36,483
We're just saying goodbye!

1757
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:39,320
( all laughing )

1758
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,889
MAN: Ruska, did they beat you?

1759
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:46,026
Yeah! They beat like hell.

1760
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:49,530
Now we are going to the real hell, Ruska.

1761
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:52,499
All that before was the highest circle.

1762
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:55,803
Almost paradise.

1763
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:59,440
Ruska, we'll meet in camp!

1764
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,477
Don't be afraid, Ruska.

1765
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,380
They are frightened themselves.

1766
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:17,057
( melancholic theme playing )

1767
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:30,237
( suspenseful theme playing )

1768
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,641
( wind whistling )

We brought him over here.

BETTY: The day we brought him home I was sitting at the cage

that we had him in, talking to him softly, calmly.

You know, telling him, "What a cute little baby you are."

And I was trying to feed him stuff through the mesh wire.

94
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,216
Of course he was scared, and he was growling

95
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,218
and he was making sounds.

96
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,853
He didn't want nothing to do with me.

From that time on, even the following year when he came back

98
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,127
out of hibernation I was the one that seemed

99
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,962
to go out and feed him.

100
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:08,334
Mike got some pictures of it and whatnot, but it just seemed

101
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,472
like the two of connected more so that any

102
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,273
of the other animals that were here.

103
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,275
He still holds a special spot in my heart.

104
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,744
He always will.

105
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,580
MICHAEL: You know, he's just a really nice bear.

106
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,050
He's so passive, he won't get into fights with anybody.

107
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,820
No matter how hungry he is if another bear comes,

108
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,155
he wants to join him, he just lets him.

109
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,757
He won't chase him off like the other bears.

110
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,024
He's one bear that will not.

BETTY: I wake up in the morning, sometimes I wake

up to the sounds of the bears outside.

113
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,265
That's what wakes me up.

114
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,667
Sometimes there's one, up to five

115

and six bear out there eating.

116

It's really neat.

117
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,941
It's better than waking up to traffic,

118
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,476
sirens, stuff in the city.

119
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,979
It's peaceful, it's calming, it's cool.

120
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,882
MICHAEL: He was the first one to take a doughnut

121
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:06,292
out of my mouth when he was little.

122
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:11,097
As he got bigger, every fall, he'd bring cubs with him.

123
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,300
It is odd that a male bear would bring cubs.

124
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,171
They're supposed to kill them, everything I'd ever learned.

125
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,273
And one year he brought five cubs.

126
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,108
They were either orphaned or abandoned, we don't know

127
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,176
where he picked them up.

128
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,912
He'd bring them to the troughs, they ate,

129
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,349
he lay down while they ate, then he ate, then they'd all go.

130
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,617
Betty, my wife, wondered

131
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,422
if perhaps he knew what it was like to be an orphan.

132
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:39,292
We don't know what's going on in his head.

133
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,563
But it was those instances and other things

134
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:49,001
that were happening here why I remembered somewhere back

135
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,772
in my youth, either hearing a scripture or having read it,

136
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:58,744
something about a bear and a calf, and a lion and a kid.

137
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,181
And so I started researching my bible and I found Isaiah 11.

138
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,984
And so I believe this was a foreshadow of what is coming.

139
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,820
It's not here yet but it's a blueprint of what's coming,

The lion will lay with the lamb, the bear will graze

and a child shall lead them.

So I'm like a child, I'm leading them.

MICHAEL: That's pretty cool, these two playing.

164
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,824
NARRATOR: Sanctuary is not just in the name

165
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,159
of this unusual place.

166
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,561
It's a special word for Michael.

167
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:28,301
A sanctuary for the injured, the abandoned, the orphaned.

168
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,038
MICHAEL: Well, every year, the third weekend in August,

169
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,908
they have what's called the Emo Fair.

170
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,544
I get a call the day that they're setting

171
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,315
up from this guy telling me he's got a raccoon,

172
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,250
he's been carrying it with him for two months.

173
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,620
He was trying to find a place to bring her because it just lives

174
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,456
in a trailer with him, traveling all over the place.

175
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,826
He wondered if we could take care of her,

176
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,227
so I said, "I'll be right down."

177
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,931
I picked her up, heard the story of where they found her

178
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,299
in a camp ground almost dead.

179
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,969
Just barely able to navigate at night.

180
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:07,373
He figured the mother had been hurt and he did a great thing.

181
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,810
He did call the government, they insisted that it was illegal

182
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,080
for him to have her and that he bring her

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,781
down so they can give her a needle and put her down.

184
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,352
He said, "No, that ain't happening."

185
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,854
So, I picked her up.

186
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:26,225
And I told the daughter, who was 15, I told her that I'm going

187
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,594
to call her "Destiny" because of all the different things

188
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,895
that had to happen.

189
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,064
All the perfect timing, all these things had to happen

190
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,066
for her to end up here at Isaiah 11.

191
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,603
That's the only name I could give her, "Destiny."

192
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,207
It was her destiny to be here.

193
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,442
I give her milk, and all raccoons

194
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,245
for some reason just love Butter Tarts.

195
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,481
So she gets that, she gets raisin bread soaked

196
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,750
in milk and corn on the cob.

197
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,219
She loves corn on the cob,

198
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,887
which I guess is a natural raccoon diet.

199
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,657
You're not going under the deck, it's a little too early.

200
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,393
She's number fourteen.

201
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,627
Fourteen raccoons we've rescued and released.

202
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,031
Some of them, when they got here they were

203
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:13,205
so small their eyes were just opening.

204
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,206
Everybody gets along here.

205
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,441
The birds play.

206
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,309
. . the bird plays with the cats and...

207
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,812
It's just amazing the stuff that goes on here.

208
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,615
Say bye! Bye bye!

209
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,751
Bye bye, bye bye!

210
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:30,856
NARRATOR: As Michael opened up his property and his heart

211
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,994
to these animals, unusual things began to happen.

212
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,663
MICHAEL: A mother with three cubs shows up.

213
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,300
She brings the three cubs on the deck and leaves.

214
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,969
I'm going, "I don't believe this is happening."

215
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:48,274
Why would this strange bear bring her three cubs here?

216
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:51,510
I'm bottle-feeding them, they're fighting over treats,

217
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,012
and then twenty minutes later she comes

218
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,314
and all she does is eat out of my hand, too.

219
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,683
What is going on here?

220
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,953
And then all these other bears, all these things that happen.

221
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,921
What is going on here?

222
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,756
I've got no training for this.

223
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,424
I don't have any degrees or initials

224
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,959
in front or behind my name.

225
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,428
What is going on here?

226
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,997
That's why I call it Isaiah 11.

227
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:16,702
A male bear is not supposed to share cake with cubs.

228
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,636
I've got photographs.

229
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,971
There he is.

230
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:25,911
Big, big male sharing a cake with three cubs and the mom.

231
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,247
This is just one of the trails I've blasted through here.

232
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,782
Man, I used to walk, and my wife used

233
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,119
to walk all the time around the property.

234
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,621
The other thing I've noticed

235
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,857
about the bears is how sociable they are

236
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,659
and how they remember each other from generation to generation.

237
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,363
Sometimes they'll be separated from the fall before

238
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,066
and they'll come together for the last couple of months.

239
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,168
They'll remember, "Oh, there's food here."

240
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,269
And all of a sudden they'll show up.

241
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,637
There will be a little bit

242
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,306
of nattering then you'll see them going slowly towards each

243
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,175
other, sniffing noses, they eat,

244
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,576
then they romp, playing together.

245
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,644
I know who they are.

246
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,446
I'm like, "You're the generation before.

247
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,449
This is your step-sister, or your step brother."

248
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,683
Or something, whatever.

249
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:09,221
So I know when one of these are killed a whole bunch

250
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,990
of them are affected by that.

251
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,725
I see it when there's one that arrives sick.

252
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,128
They seem to sense that there's something wrong with this bear,

253
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,798
and they'll do like a protection to make sure he's getting food.

254
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,233
They'll back off and let it eat.

255
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:25,204
Oh, there's one sitting right there.

256
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:25,838
Hey, there we go.

257
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,040
That's Milo.

258
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,041
C'mon Milo.

259
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,577
See, he wasn't worried about our voice,

260
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,213
he was just wanting to hit that brush.

261
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,448
One thing I notice about bears, see this one here ran,

262
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,484
not because of our voices or because they saw us,

263
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,886
but because I brushed against that branch.

264
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,590
One thing I noticed early on is bears actually use weapons

265
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,027
as a tool against something they want

266
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,428
to chase away, to scare away.

267
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,299
And what they'll do is they'll simply go in behind something

268
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,503
like this, and they'll smack it down.

269
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,640
Just smack!

270
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,411
One time I had, when I was first starting this, I had a mom,

271
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,715
two moms and their cubs by this one tree here and I was going

272
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,749
over there to feed them.

273
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,051
Both moms charge me at the same time.

274
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,652
Each had their own little tree.

275
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,222
They smacked it on the ground and warned me.

276
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,757
So I said, "Okay, here you go."

277
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,593
And I just threw it to them and they were okay.

278
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,027
I don't know if anybody knows this,

279
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,663
that bears actually use tools as a weapon

280
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,499
to help drive off something they want to chase away.

281
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,603
They'll use a tree, a small sapling, and to whip it down.

282
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,872
It just makes a sound like a whip hitting the ground.

283
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,574
That's pretty cool.

284
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,611
So, I'm not a bear expert but I am learning all the time.

285
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,879
Different things I pick up.

286
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:48,187
I have to keep my little trail clean, you know?

287
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:53,592
Well, back when I was six years old I was given the choice

288
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,194
about a puppy in a basement

289
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,697
in Winnipeg cause we were leaving the city

290
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,466
to move onto a farm.

291
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,836
They took me down some stairs to the basement, there was a litter

292
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,238
of puppies and one of them left the litter

293
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,507
and come running over to me.

294
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,477
I picked him up and figured that's the one,

295
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,579
cause he likes me.

296
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,749
So, I figured I'd take this one, and I called him Moxy.

297
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,284
I have no idea where that came from.

298
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:23,989
I don't even know what it means but that's what I called him.

299
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:29,094
This puppy, he brought a connection to me.

300
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,298
He was something that loved me no matter what.

301
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,067
No matter how bad I was, no matter how many spankings I got

302
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,071
from my parents he still licked my hand and my face.

303
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,207
To him I wasn't a bad person.

304
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,612
So I grew this really, really tight bond with this little dog

305
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,715
that we then went to the country with.

306
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:57,456
So, with this puppy called Moxy, it was my first introduction

307
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:07,966
to an animal that I can remember.

308
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,537
A couple of years later we had some company from Winnipeg

309
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,641
and we had very little food.

310
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,343
The fact that we were even alive is a miracle

311
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,844
because there was no welfare back then.

312
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,380
There was no back up system.

313
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,750
So, I remember the dog eating basically scraps.

314
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,220
Potatoes! Can you imagine dog eating potatoes?

315
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,055
Whatever we had, so the dog was always

316
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,323
on the verge of starvation.

317
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,157
I mean, so were we.

318
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,460
We had some people come over.

319
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,729
This little girl went over to his dish

320
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,831
that he'd just been given some scrap food

321
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,865
and she went over to his dish.

322
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,702
The dog nipped her just above the eye.

323
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,039
And of course she comes in screaming,

324
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,374
got everybody all upset.

325
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,545
My dog's full-grown now.

326
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,784
The next thing I remember, I see my father has my dog on a rope

327
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,220
and he's got the twenty-two in his hand

328
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,555
and he's walking off into the bush.

329
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,526
I'm screaming and yelling, bawling my head off.

330
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,961
I don't know what he's going to do

331
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,129
with it, it doesn't look good.

332
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,966
Then I watched them fade off

333
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:19,104
through the meadow and into the trees.

334
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:26,678
You know, that day was a turning point

335
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,881
in my life towards how I saw my father.

336
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:35,120
And it wasn't good.

337
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,027
A murderous spirit rose up in me that was just so violent.

338
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:48,567
And unfortunately I took it out on my siblings.

339
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,670
I was very cruel to them.

340
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,308
I had a real resistance to anything

341
00:17:56,308 --> 00:18:00,646
that wanted to be attached to me.

342
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:06,518
Because something was going to happen to it.

343
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:11,056
It was going to either die or be killed.

344
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,858
NARRATOR: Running Paradise isn't easy.

345
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,461
In fact, it's a lot of hard work.

346
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,130
There's no such thing as Purina "Bear" Chow.

347
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,099
So, four times a week, Michael gets

348
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,568
in his 1998 GMC pickup truck

349
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,205
and makes the 70 mile round trip into town for food.

350
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,208
His truck has over 270,000 miles on it.

351
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,743
MICHAEL: I just call my buddy and he just nods his head,

352
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,678
"Yeah, you're right, yeah, yeah.

353
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,880
You got that right, yeah.

354
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,349
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah."

355
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,651
[ chuckle ]

356
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:47,126
It's a 24/7, 365 days a year job with this wildlife sanctuary.

357
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,229
There is always food to be gathered up.

358
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,364
The one break I get is in the wintertime

359
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:56,335
where I only have to go twice a week.

360
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,139
But in the summer time I've got to go four times a week

361
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,408
into Fort Francis to pick up this food

362
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:07,146
because we're always day-to-day.

363
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,113
Isn't that right buddy?

364
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,183
"Yeah, you got it."

365
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,951
I hate when food is wasted.

366
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,820
I just can't stand it because of the way I grew

367
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,859
up we didn't have much.

368
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,461
It would be perfectly fine with me

369
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,230
if there was never any stuff thrown away,

370
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,999
it all went to people.

371
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,233
That would be fine with me

372
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,002
because then I know God would provide some other way

373
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,937
for the animals.

374
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,071
But in the mean time,

375
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,242
while they're doing this why take it to the dump?

376
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,744
Might as well make some good use out of it

377
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,113
and feed the wildlife that needs it.

378
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,315
I mean, it sounds like a simple meal for bears,

379
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,518
but there's so much minerals and vitamins and stuff in bread.

380
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,988
That's why their coats are so healthy looking.

381
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,356
Isn't that right buddy?

382
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:51,990
"Yeah."

383
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,029
[ chuckle ]

384
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,399
One time I had two guys and their girlfriends here

385
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,533
in their mid-twenties.

386
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,235
The girls were in the back and this whole trip

387
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,904
through here they were laughing and giggling.

388
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,173
I got to about there and I turned around and I said,

389
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,608
"I realize you guys aren't laughing

390
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,244
because something's funny, you guys are laughing

391
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,646
because you're scared stiff, right?"

392
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,883
Then one of the girls says "Well, we were talking about,

393
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,987
what are we going to do if a bear comes out of the woods.

394
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,956
What are we going to do?"

395
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,793
I said, "Well, you can pray."

396
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,994
[ chuckles ]

397
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,397
NARRATOR: Michael's parents left Nazi Germany

398
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,901
after Hitler's defeat and immigrated to Canada.

399
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,072
Life was harsh, and cruel.

400
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,810
And sometimes, so were they.

401
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:55,153
There was a lot of abuse from the parents towards us.

402
00:20:55,153 --> 00:21:05,330
Some of the abuse I don't want to, you know, it's...

403
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,201
From a young age my sister and I were planning on running away.

404
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,402
And actually one day we did.

405
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,704
In the middle of winter we packed our little slay

406
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,374
and we were running away from home.

407
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,743
We were five and six years old probably.

408
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:18,443
Or four and five.

409
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,811
Something like that.

410
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,847
I was terrified of my father.

411
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:28,353
Both parents, terrified of them.

412
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,658
My sister and I would, she's a year and a half younger than me,

413
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,695
I'm the oldest of eleven.

414
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,497
If our parents left the house

415
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:42,200
to go somewhere we would secretively, quietly whisper

416
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,038
in a corner of the, wherever we were, try and come

417
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:52,678
up with a plan of how we could kill them.

418
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:58,150
Whether people like to hear it or not it's part of my past.

419
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,186
It's part of the healing that my gracious heavenly father brought

420
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,587
me through.

421
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,824
The first time I attempted suicide I was nine years old.

422
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,896
Now, can you imagine a child?

423
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:16,968
I had witnessed my uncles and my father killing an animal.

424
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:22,274
What they did was they took a hammer and they hit the calf

425
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,576
or the cow on the head with this hammer.

426
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,814
It fell to the ground and then they would cut the throat

427
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,315
and bleed it.

428
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,984
Well, in my young little mind it was the hammer blow

429
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,386
that killed the animal.

430
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,891
So one day when I was down in the barnyard working with the,

431
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,827
whatever I was doing there, I took a hammer

432
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,328
and I walloped myself right

433
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,030
between the eyes with this hammer.

434
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,367
And all I ended up with is this great big mouse on my head

435
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,169
and I had to lie to my mother how it got there.

436
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,139
Then a couple of years later I tried to hang myself.

437
00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:08,420
I got scars on the bottom of my neck here, but the rope broke.

438
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,355
Going to Fort Francis, which is

439
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,892
like a thirty-five mile one way trip and picking

440
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,427
up at the different destinations.

441
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:21,399
It usually takes me a couple, a couple and a half,

442
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,468
it's sometimes even three hours cause I might have to wait

443
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,872
for one of the bread trucks to come back.

444
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,373
So there goes the morning.

445
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,742
Then I go home and I sort

446
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,478
through everything, separate everything.

447
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,546
There goes another hour.

448
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,047
And then it's feeding's another hour.

449
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,216
So the whole morning is until noon, one o'clock,

450
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:42,087
is usually dedicated every two days just

451
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,122
to get the food together.

452
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,758
Get it in the tubs and get it sorted out.

453
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,694
Get the doughnuts and the cakes sorted out.

454
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,329
Then the doughnuts and stuff I hold back,

455
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,100
they're just treats for...

456
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,201
The little girl waved.

457
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:02,707
The horns, they love the horns on the truck

458
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:03,742
[ chuckle ]

459
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:04,876
. Some people might think that bears,

460
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,313
that all they're getting is the sweets and stuff,

461
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,447
but they're just the treats.

462
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,683
The cakes are held back for the moms with cubs

463
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:15,086
so they can produce milk better and the doughnuts

464
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,122
and the cookies are all held back, always,

465
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,757
for when people show up.

466
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,826
If nobody shows up and I've got pails left,

467
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,728
then I just fire them out for them.

468
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:29,801
So the bears have an all-raw, very, very healthy diet.

469
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,305
I get them what fruits I can when I find them.

470
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,441
They love cabbage, they love lettuce.

471
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,811
A lot of times stores throw it out because it's out-dated.

472
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,215
When I get milks or yogurts, cheeses, that all goes

473
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,418
into one of the troughs there.

474
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,555
They have a good life.

475
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,124
This truck has hauled a lot of stuff, man!

476
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,927
It's a tired, old truck too.

The body's falling apart now.

479
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:19,050
And I want a Ford!

00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,070
for his beloved bears.

483
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,440
They're only three weeks away from hibernation

484
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,478
and the bears need a remarkable 24,000 calories a day

485
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,946
to store fat for the winter.

486
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:50,615
So, Michael's made friends with the folks

487
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,750
at local grocery stores,

488
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,519
where they donate their excess or expired food.

489
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,721
Michael is deeply grateful.

490
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,158
Along the way, he never misses an opportunity

491
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,627
to talk about his passion.

492
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,729
MICHAEL: Good morning!

493
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:11,069
Would you like a brochure?

494
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,371
If you want to come with your family it's free, come out

495
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,408
and visit, feed some bears if you want to.

496
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,442
WOMAN IN CAR: Okay.

497
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:23,014
MICHAEL: Have a good day, God bless.

498
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,449
There's three more boxes inside.

499
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:28,186
A lot of times I'll get seven, eight, or nine boxes.

500
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:33,191
Today it's a little bit skimpy but it's better than nothing.

501
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,529
Every little bit helps.

502
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,499
This is lots of fun when you're in the middle of a sleet storm.

503
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,001
Boy, snowing, wet, rain!

504
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:48,406
But the show must go on!

505
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:52,711
I will not let these animals go hungry,

506
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,280
I don't care what it takes.

507
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,616
They've never yet gone without.

508
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:04,923
I will go without first.

509
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:15,700
And I do go without a lot.

510
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,905
It's been a really neat experience having what the Bible

511
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,375
would call "sparrow faith."

512
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,443
When God says, "The sparrow don't worry

513
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,713
about what he's going to eat, I feed him every day."

514
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,715
So he says, "don't worry about what you're going to wear,

515
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,951
don't worry about what you're going to eat.

516
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:33,752
I'll look after you."

517
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,120
That was the plan all along.

518
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,923
Right from Adam on, that was the plan.

519
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,460
And we're getting back to that so I have

520
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,232
to remind myself every day not to worry about the supplies,

521
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,333
not to worry about the food.

522
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,435
That some how God is going to see it through.

523
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:59,310
I've got to have sparrow like faith that he is going

524
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:08,053
to provide the manna every day.

525
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:15,860
In the spring or summer we were each given a little ducking,

526
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,563
my sister and I, to look after.

527
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,566
It was our job to raise it, make sure they had food,

528
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,068
make sure they had water.

529
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,669
We assumed they were our pets.

530
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,205
And we treated them as such.

531
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,708
We had no idea that they were going to go on the dinner plate

532
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,078
when they were bigger.

533
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,914
So one day, out of the blue, my mother tells me to go down

534
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,918
and get one of the ducks and kill it on the chopping block.

535
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,588
And I was, "What?!"

536
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,025
I mean, I did't say that because you don't question anything.

537
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,560
When they said do something you...

538
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,762
See, there was no communication

539
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,363
in our house except, "yes" or "no."

540
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:57,602
You don't ask, you don't question, you just do.

541
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:02,207
I remember picking up this duck, which was a good size now

542
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,610
and walking what seemed like a long walk from the building

543
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,712
where it was up to the woodshed to where the chopping block

544
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,915
and the ax were, and apologizing to it profusely.

545
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,883
I said, "I don't want to do this.

546
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:15,153
I don't want to kill you."

547
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,956
But my, I had, my mother want...

548
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,257
"I don't want to do this."

549
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:24,062
And so then she opens the door and hollers out, again,

550
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,698
in German you know, "Have you got that done yet?"

551
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,867
And I'm standing there with the duck and I said,

552
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,101
"I don't want to do this!

553
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,503
I don't want to kill!"

554
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:35,840
And then she started hurling insults at me.

555
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,575

556

560
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,621
She comes over and she grabbed me

561
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,525
and like this, kinda shook me.

562
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,394
Took the duck out of my hand, put it on the block,

563
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,330
took my hand, put it on the duck.

564
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,100
Put the ax in my hand, took her hand over my hand,

565
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:07,872
lifted up the ax and chopped its head off.

566
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,210
The second that ax chopped that ducks head off...

567
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:17,115
the fury, the anger, the murderous spirit

568
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,585
in me towards my mother now, was almost out of control.

Rage. That is not something you put a child through.

570

00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:49,240
[ Bear growling in the back ground. ]

644
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,941
[ Michael makes guttural sounds ]

645
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:56,314
Here comes their mom.

646
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,618
Come on Flicka, hey girl.

647
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:06,924
Hey little Patty.

648
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:11,429
NARRATOR: Michael's sanctuary is a peaceful place.

649
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:28,946
But it was a dark and painful journey to get here.

650
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,249
MICHAEL: All I wanted was love.

651
00:37:32,249 --> 00:38:03,347
I remember one time standing in Calgary at nighttime all

652
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:13,257
by myself looking at all the lights at all these apartments

653
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,559
and just screaming out, "God,

654
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,896
if you're out there why won't somebody just love me?

655
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:24,602
Why? Why am I all alone, why won't anybody love me?

656
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:30,374
Why can't I love anybody?

657
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:36,514
Why are you always so angry at me?

658
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,449
Because that's what I was taught in church.

659
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,184
Lightning bolts, two by fours.

660
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,986
It was so bad that if I hurt myself

661
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:47,625
on a job I'd just scream out, "Why, what did I do now?"

662
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,428
But that's the theology that I'd had drummed into me

663
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,730
from my parents at home and from the church I went to.

664
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:58,135
That God was a god of judgment and anger and wrath.

665
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,470
God was wrought!

666
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,605
You are good for nothing.

667
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,608
You'll never amount to anything.

668
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,411
Famous words of my parents.

669
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,612
So you start believing it.

670
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,515
And then as the pressure builds you just want out,

671
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,450
you want to check out.

672
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,818
I'm out of here.

673
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,152
So I didn't care.

674
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,288
You know, all these questions, what is going on here?

675
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:20,091
I wanted to know, I wanted to have a relationship with you.

676
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,293
I am fed up, sick and tired of religion.

677
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,528
I want nothing to do with religion.

678
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,064
I want a relationship with my heavenly Father

679
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,833
who says that He loves me.

680
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:34,171
And that through these animals he has been reintroducing his

681
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:37,842
incredible love for me through them,

682
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,577
and giving me this love for them.

683
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,780
This compassion and then reopen my heart

684
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,015
to be also compassionate and more loving to people

685
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,853
because I'd written people off.

686
00:39:48,853 --> 00:40:01,432
I'd just had it with people, humanity.

687
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,500
[ Honks horn ]

688
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:14,945
That's an old Buick horn I put in here.

689
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:20,017
Well, today we're going to go down about a mile into the bush.

690
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,687
An area where I first started logging with the tractor

691
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,190
and I put brush piles together

692
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,093
so the bears could use them as dens.

693
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,863
I know of at least one that's used every winter as a den

694
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,331
so we're going to go have a look at it.

695
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:38,769
We should see some evidence of the hole where they go in.

696
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,338
If there's any trampled grass or whatever.

697
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:47,478
You might even see a bear or two.

698
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,512
You can see where the bear have all been active,

699
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,079
where all the grass if flattened out.

700
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,014
Look at that.

701
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,581
They've been very active in here.

702
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,083
There's a den.

703
00:40:53,083 --> 00:41:10,601
There's a den, the entrance is on the other side of there.

704
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:17,508
Yeah, you can see they've been flattening down trees.

705
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,244
There's a lot of action here.

706
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,378
There's a regular trail right

707
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:28,519
through here you can see is used.

708
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:42,566
This is one of the first piles I put together for the bears.

709
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,768
You see the hole in here?

710
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:50,007
That's the hole there, that's where they go in.

711
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,577
And it looks like it's been freshly used too.

712
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:59,583
There's some evidence of some fresh trampling going on.

713
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,052
Anybody home?

714
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:09,193
Hello? Anybody home?

715
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:14,899
It's me, come to say hi!

716
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,902
Nobody home.

717
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,838
But these are the kind of piles I put, I mean hundreds

718
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,776
of these all over the place, specifically for bears.

719
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,212
Even when I didn't know that there were bears here,

720
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,314
I figured, how many places...?

721
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,217
If I build it they will come.

722
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,285
And they did.

723
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:38,856
I saw that movie, that was a great movie.

724
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,025
Look at all the evidence of the bear, all traffic.

725
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,527
Look at all the flattened grass.

726
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:47,231
All the trails.

727
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,669
I noticed a few years ago when I was back here cleaning up I saw

728
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,407
that a lot of them, they'll go right in this tall grass

729
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,410
and you can see the areas where they've lain down.

730
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,845
See, that's pretty cool.

731
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:06,317
So, when they're buried into that the flies are harder to get

732
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,419
at them, it's cool and moist.

733
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,122
The swamp is moisture so it cools them down.

734
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:19,363
And they use this whole are, it's full of sleeping patches.

735
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:23,067
One year I know that in this grass one bear hibernated here

736
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,270
for the winter because come the spring break up I saw

737
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,106
in the snow tracks coming out of what looked like a den,

738
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,609
but it was just the snow that had crystallized and frozen

739
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,510
around him in the grass.

740
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,880
That's when I started realizing that bears don't all den up.

741
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,950
Only the females that are pregnant den up or the ones

742
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,286
that have their first year cubs with them for the second winter.

743
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,487
They'll den up.

744
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,689
All the other bears, they'll just back themselves

745
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,959
into tall grass like this

746
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,596
and cover themselves and get snowed over.

747
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:56,166
We have a number of bears that half their ears froze off.

748
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,969
The top part because their head wasn't properly buried.

749
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:02,706
Blondie, one side of his one ear half gone one side

750
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,609
because he didn't have that head protected too well enough.

751
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:09,013
Because they'll just back themselves under a fallen balsam

752
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,748
or something, or into tall grass,

753
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,717
and just let themselves be snowed over.

754
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:14,818
Bear in the tree!

755
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,488
A couple of them, one in each tree there.

756
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,655
Three cubs.

757
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:24,428
Out in the middle of nowhere, isn't that cool?

758
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,796
NARRATOR: At one time,

759
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,899
Michael could have been driving a golf cart along the green.

760
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,769
Instead, he drives an All Terrain Vehicle

761
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,437
through the brush.

762
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,139
He's been feeding and caring the

763
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,575
for bears every day for over eight years.

764
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,111
It's hard work, but it's no chore for Michael.

765
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:48,752
To him, it's a reward.

766
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,554
MICHAEL: Oh, raccoons!

767
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,258
Raccoons are in here.

768
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,493
How you doing?

769
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:02,332
That's the one's we raised last year.

770
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:17,347
Sorry to startle you like that, did you get your doughnuts?

771
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,484
I remember going to the Winnipeg Zoo and being fascinated

772
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:24,154
but also it wasn't very long and I felt sorry

773
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,291
for those animals being caged up in these places like this.

774
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:35,199
And I wanted to set them free.

775
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,070
So, that's why the sign here I have, "The Perfect Zoo!!!

776
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,572
People Caged.

777
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:55,819
Wildlife Free."

778
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,423
I couldn't understand why people would want

779
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,625
to put these big animals in such a dirty little spot.

780
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,962
And they were just pacing, I knew that they were unhappy.

781
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:09,133
And so when I went to the Vancouver Zoo I tried

782
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,434
to plot and I planned.

783
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,668
How can I set them free?

784
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,438
But I realized that if I set these wolves and tigers,

785
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,506
they're all going to get killed

786
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,406
because they're going to be in the city.

787
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,174
They're going to be shot.

788
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:20,144
I can't just release them.

789
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:34,691
So I turned away from going to zoos cause I couldn't handle it.

790
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:42,699
What you doing up there, eh?

791
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:48,472
Here you go.

792
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,507
There you go.

793
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,577
There you go.

794
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,879
Come on Anson, come on Lightning, come on Milo.

795
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:56,513
Come here.

796
00:46:56,513 --> 00:47:06,123
Here you go.

797
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,825
Whoops. Yes sir.

798
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,993
So I try to study characteristics of the bear,

799
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,062
because that's the only way to remember them.

800
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,531
Because when they're cubs, like these cubs, okay,

801
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,700
I might be able to tell a difference between some of them.

802
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,836
But when they come back next spring I'll have no clue

803

00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,867
That my feeding these animals is to help them survive.

965
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:15,805
What is so wrong with that, why are you so upset?

966
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,042
Well, these bears are going to go kill people.

967
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,744
No they're no.

968
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,147
I've got people phoning me up, coming here and mocking me,

969
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,850
saying, "Well, Michael, how many born again bears do you

970
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,017
have now?"

971
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,720
Here you go, come on Anson, come on Lightning.

972
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,356
Here we go, here we go.

973
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,158
Come on, here you go.

974
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,493
Here you go, there you are.

975
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:41,598
Here you are, come one, here we go.

976
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,434
Here you are.

977
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:51,174
Here you guys go, good shot.

978
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:55,645
Here you go, here you are, here we go.

979
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:59,215
Good girl, come on.

980
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:05,688
This is Anson, little Missy, and that's Lightening.

981
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:10,226
These cubs are disciplined by their mom for a reason.

982
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,129
To learn how to survive they must obey.

983
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,899
They must obey everything the mother tells them.

984
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,834
As I watch them, every single detail

985
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:20,069
that she teaches them, it's incredible.

986
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,005
It's all to survive.

987
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,008
What to eat, when it's going to be where.

988
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,611
You know, when to run, when to attack, and to listen.

989
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,480
What noises to respond to.

990
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,515
It's amazing.

991
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:33,850
Want some pie Milo?

992
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,653
Eh, want some apple pie.

993
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:43,927
Come and get it.

994
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:49,232
Her and Otis were abandoned by their mother in the middle

995
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,635
of May because that bear Chocolate came around

996
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,870
and he was determined he was going

997
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,606
to breed her even though she had these new born cubs.

998
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,775
And I called them Milo and Otis

999
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:02,212
because of the Walt Disney show The Incredible Journey and I

1000
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,748
thought these two guys are kind of lost, you know.

1001
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:09,419
Like all these cubs, we've got eighteen of them here.

1002
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,055
Eighteen little ones this year, they're all going to be

1003
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:15,758
in for a nasty shock come next spring.

1004
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:19,729
About May the mothers will start driving them off.

1005
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,130
We're going to have a whole yard full

1006
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,533
of confused cubs not knowing why their mothers don't love

1007
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,301
them anymore.

1008
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,471
The cubs will go up, they'll be way up on top of those trees,

1009
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,074
laying out on top of the boughs sound asleep.

1010
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,877
A nice little breeze, and the mom's sometimes will lay

1011
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,678
down at the bottom and sleep with them.

1012
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,614
Or they'll go up the tree part ways and sleep with them.

1013
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,582
Or they'll just leave, for hours.

1014
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,651
This year we have eighteen cubs.

1015
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,386
Eighteen cubs.

1016
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:47,123
I had a bear come here so sick, about a three year old

1017
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:47,957
and it was just about dead.

1018
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,126
But I already knew what to do

1019
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,195
because I realize it was anti-freeze poisoning.

1020
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,365
I had learned from a guy when the first cub arrived

1021
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,167
and he told me, I was just starting this.

1022
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,670
I was only the second year, I was just still throwing food.

1023
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,942
And he said well, it sounds like anti-freeze poisoning to me.

1024
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:09,212
Get some raw eggs, cook up some...

1025
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,446
some oat...

1026
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,349
some oatmeal, and put cream in it.

1027
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,385
All the rich stuff you can get, then separate it

1028
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,486
from its mother, and give it to it.

1029
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,054
And I said, "I'll get right on that.

1030
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,189
What do you mean separate the cub from its mother?

1031
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,191
You nuts?"

1032
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,626
Well I did manage to pull it off.

1033
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,930
I kept the mom and the two eating cubs busy and then I went

1034
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,766
over and gave the pot, and he ate the whole thing.

1035
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,935
The next day he didn't show up and I thought he'd gone,

1036
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,838
but the next day he came and he's one of our bears.

1037
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,309
In fact he's the bear we call Big John.

1038
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:44,814
Yeah, Charlie came here, he's been with us four years.

1039
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,317
I'm guessing he's about seven or eight.

1040
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,853
Last summer he arrived with a gunshot wound.

1041
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,390
I talked to some people about that and they said

1042
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:58,394
that there are guys around who just love to gut-shoot bears

1043
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,929
and let them run off and die whenever.

1044
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,065
They just gut-shoot them just for the sake

1045
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,267
of it, for the fun of it.

1046
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,704
Obviously they didn't hit any vital organs.

1047
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,440
He's pulled, he's made it.

1048
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,574
Eh, Charlie?

1049
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,510
Good boy! Now, this year you can't see the entry

1050
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,712
would anymore.

1051
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:16,813
The hairs all grown over, the skin's grown back

1052
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,082
because it's just a small little hole.

1053
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:22,251
But that side was a horrible mess.

1054
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:28,324
What? He's about six hundred pounds, this boy.

1055
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,926
Hey, hey Smoke.

1056
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,294
There you go buddy.

1057
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:34,330
There you go, good boy.

1058
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,532
They're naturally grazers.

1059
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,201
I've got video of a bear going around here

1060
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,738
in the spring just mowing my lawn beautifully.

1061
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,208
Then I started studying up on bear and going back to Genesis

1062
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:50,179
and realized that when Father had made them all everything was

1063
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:55,485
to be eating the grasses and the herbs of the field.

1064
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,320
So, that means everything, including us,

1065
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,856
we're all vegetarians when we start with.

1066
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,992
NARRATOR: Michael has a special bond with his animals.

1067
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,995
But of all his animals, few have touched him

1068
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,631
like a bald eagle he named Skywalker.

1069
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:19,275
Although it's illegal to keep a bald eagle in captivity,

1070
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,210
Native Americans are exempt.

1071
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,147
And so, when a local Indian tribe found an eagle

1072
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,916
that had been shot, the First Nations Police called

1073
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,251
to Michael for help.

1074
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:32,455
Michael began to care for the injured animal and slowly,

1075
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:35,158
day by day, he nursed the eagle to life.

1076
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,860
MICHAEL: I sat up here

1077
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,229
until about midnight journaling everything that happened,

1078
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:42,965
all of the details while they were still fresh.

1079
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,867
July the 7, 2010

1080
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,103
In Memory of Skywalker, the Eagle

1081
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,738
Ten thirty in the morning I received a call

1082
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,074
from Sabaskon Reserve, Nestor Falls, Ontario,

1083
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,042
that there was an eagle with a bad wing,

1084
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:57,780
trapped in the fenced area of a baseball diamond, would I come

1085
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,782
and take him to our sanctuary?

1086
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,285
I said I'd be there as soon as possible.

1087
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,120
On the drive up, I had already decided

1088
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,488
to call the eagle Skywalker.

1089
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:09,058
I was finished around 7 p.m. and he was lying on his stomach,

1090
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,660
legs outback, and talons .

1091
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,429
. . talons clenched tight

1092
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,299
and only breathing every ten to fifteen seconds.

1093
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,734
His whole body was limp.

1094
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:22,105
Then I had no choice but to leave him in the Father's hands,

1095
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,174
He had created him and was well capable of restoring him

1096
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:27,276
if it was in His will and plan.

1097
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,312
I had done all I could do.

1098
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,014
The next morning I climbed up the ladder and said,

1099
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,351
well Father lets see what you have done and there he was.

1100
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:39,388
Perched on top of a cedar pole, standing as proud as could be,

1101
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,424
just looking at me with those piercing white eyes

1102
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,426
as if nothing had ever happened or was wrong.

1103
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:47,763
I just rejoiced and thanked the Father for this miracle and went

1104
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:49,832
to pat Skywalker on the head and spoke to him

1105
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,701
for about five minutes.

1106
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,338
I was ecstatic and full of joy for him because just hours ago,

1107
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,007
he would have been considered clinically dead.

1108
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,476
By evening he was perched on a board at the highest point

1109
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,846
in his cage, a feat only a strong bird could climb to.

1110
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:06,349
Skywalker would not take any food on Monday,

1111
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,384
but he climbed everywhere and seemed to take water.

1112
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,587
Tuesday morning no change, did not accept any food,

1113
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:14,257
just tasted it and spit it out.

1114
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,860
At eight fifteen on Wednesday morning I went to check

1115
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:24,934
on Skywalker and he was lying on his stomach.

1116
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,803
He had passed away not much earlier.

1117
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:28,971
[ crying ]

1118
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,007
I was devastated and asked God, why?

1119
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:36,212
Why? Why? I petted his head as I knelt by him and apologized

1120
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:43,619
that I had not done more, and I wept over him.

1121
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,290
I was devastated and sobbed so hard and so long that I was weak

1122
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,125
and barely able to walk to my truck

1123
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,560
and drive the thirty miles to town.

1124
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,096
At Wal-Mart I picked up a replacement bottle of peroxide

1125
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:55,965
for my neighbor and while at the checkout,

1126
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,335
where one of the ladies had called me over to serve me,

1127
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,670
we got to talking and I broke down.

1128
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:05,775
She told me that God had promised never

1129
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:08,010
to give me more than I could bear.

1130
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,513
I thanked her for reminding me of that scripture

1131
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,081
and while I was still crying,

1132
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,483
she came around and gave me a hug.

1133
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,053
I got a warm caring hug from a total stranger

1134
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,754
and I thanked my Father for her.

1135
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,857
After arriving home and unloading,

1136
01:04:21,857 --> 01:04:24,927
I knelt beside Skywalker again and stroking

1137
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,964
that gorgeous white head and looking into his beautiful,

1138
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,899
fiercely white eyes said,

1139
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:33,502
"Skywalker, you are free and I'll see you on that day

1140
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:37,006
when all creation will worship the Lamb."

1141
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:41,744
I then got up, dug a hole, and buried him.

1142
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,846
A few steps from your special place,

1143
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,415
I stopped, looked back and said,

1144
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,652
"You know, you will greatly enjoy soaring in the heights

1145

of your new sky, Skywalker.

1146
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,789
I loved you dearly and am truly grateful that God saw me worthy

1147
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,124
in trusting me with you.

1148
01:04:55,124 --> 01:05:02,298
Isaiah 40:28-31 promises me that I too will one day soar

1149
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,899
on wings like an eagle.

1150
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,668
I'll be seeing you then.

1151

Skywalker, my heart is heavy but I cannot allow it to break.

You saw all the others God has sent to me to help.

They need me and I must carry on with my destiny

1154

your journey that I set before you has come to an end

and now you will start your new one.'

I must go on."

1158

It is now Wednesday, July eighth and it is midnight.

Goodnight Skywalker.

God created you and said it was very good.

Did you know in His word He mentions eagles 34 times?

He is truly in awe and proud of His creation of your species.

I will now wear my eagle head necklace again in memory of you.

9
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,632
- Thank you, Pearl, for that fine rendition.

10
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,965
Now, a few words from the sheriff.

11
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,998
- A quick community note for you.

12
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:25,165
The Browns are having an auction this Sunday

13
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:26,265
with the proceeds going to help--

14
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,898
- That's us, that's our auction.

15
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,131
- They got chocolate cream pies at this thing.

16
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,832
- Jack, take human bites.

17
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:34,699
- Ready?

18
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,265
- Always, Cap'n.

19
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:37,565
- I look stupid.

20
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:38,799
- You're beautiful.

21
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,065
- I'd rather be sailing.

22
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,665
- Now, if you would let me talk to you a little bit

23
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,398
about firework safety.

24
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,465
Now, everyone be careful with them fireworks, okay?

25
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:50,565
And now our Independent State Youth Speech,

26
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,765
Molly-- (microphone feedback)

27
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:55,498
Molly Brown.

28
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,732
- Our ancestors fought many battles.

29
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:08,198
From the beginning of our country,

30
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,232
they have believed in faith.

31
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,732
Since my dad's always telling me that I'm stubborn,

32
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,532
I mean, independent, (audience laughter)

33
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,498
I guess our forefathers and mothers were independent, too.

34
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,965
They had faith in something they really couldn't see.

35
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,732
(striking match drowns out words)

36
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,432
to the crackle of a gun fire.

37
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:26,332
(firecrackers)

38
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:34,198
That's it, you're dead Cory.

39
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:36,398
Jack, take it back way.

40
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,365
Let's go, Jillian!

41
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,799
- Settle down, everybody, just settle down.

42
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,599
Just another prankster.

43
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,465
Pearl, can we get another one

44
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,532
of your beautiful renditions?

45
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,031
- [Voiceover] This is you, Dr. Turner?

46
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,232
- Yes, ma'am, a long time ago, when I was --

47
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,931
- And that story about the lost treasure.

48
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:58,332
Do you still believe it?

49
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,465
- Uh, as I wa saying--

50
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,232
- You never found it, did you, Dr. Turner?

51
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:06,665
- No, ma'am, just a couple of coins, an old letter,

52
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:08,565
and an awful lot of mud.

53
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:12,031
- Well, there's no sense beating a dead horse, Dr. Turner.

54
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,599
(laughter)

55
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,432
- He has not aged well, at all.

56
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:20,565
- Not aged well, huh?

57
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:23,232
Well, I still got the old Turner charm.

58
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:27,232
Plus the IQ of the combined population of this town.

59
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:29,165
Just one more piece of the puzzle,

60
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:31,665
and that treasure will be mine.

61
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:46,498
- You kids better be more careful, geez!

62
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,898
This is a new shirt.

63
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,465
- [Voiceover] I'd rather Jimmy (engine drowns out words)

64
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,198
house on the hill.

65
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,298
- Molly, could you run this right over to your grandfather?

66
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,665
It's a get-well card.

67
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,565
- But...

68
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,398
Yes, Mrs. Stephenson.

69
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:09,599
- Poor girl, being raised without a mother.

70
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,898
Practically lives on that river.

71
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:14,965
And she talks to herself.

72
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,699
A lot.

73
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:20,632
- She reminds me a lot of her grandfather.

74
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:22,365
Sometimes too much.

75
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:23,632
So, how are you doing, Paul?

76
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:26,232
You found anything, yet?

77
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:29,131
- No, not a lot of work for historians right now.

78
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:33,098
- There never is, I should know.

79
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,198
I wish I could get you on here.

80
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:37,965
- Thanks, when they cut back at the college,

81
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,131
I didn't really think I'd--

82
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,866
- Yes, yes, things are tight all over.

83
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,765
Listen, Paul, I've inventoried all of the--

84
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,198
(car honking)

85
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,965
Things you gave us from Sara's research,

86
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,498
but I can't seem to find the old diary.

87
00:05:50,498 --> 00:05:53,098
- I suppose it could be stored some place else.

88
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:55,332
After she died, I didn't really have the heart to--

89
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:59,465
- Well, without the diary, we might not be as interested.

90
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:02,398
Would your father-in-law know something?

91
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:04,931
- I don't think so, he's not doing so well.

92
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,799
- Well, how about I stop by when you have more time?

93
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,165
- Okay, sure.

94
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:13,498
(strong, whimsical music)

95
00:06:18,732 --> 00:06:21,965
- [Voiceover] Uh oh, kid, bad hair day.

96
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,632
- Alex, I'm Nurse Rancette.

97
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:27,599
Welcome to White River Foster Care.

98
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:30,898
Hands out of your pockets and look at me, please.

99
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:32,998
You've been placed in three foster homes

100
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:35,532
and run away from all three.

101
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:39,031
Each time you stole from the good people who took you in.

102
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,799
That adds up to ...

103
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,765
- Trouble.

104
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:47,165
- And now you've been sent here.

105
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:50,998
If you steal, or run from me,

106
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:54,865
the next stop is Juvenile Detention Center,

107
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:58,131
and that would be bad now, wouldn't it?

108
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,232
Simonton?

109
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,365
- Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,031
- Correct.

111
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:07,198
Rule number one, you do not leave the property grounds

112
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,498
unless otherwise authorized.

113
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,498
Do you understand?

114
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,398
What?

115
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,265
- Yeah.

116
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,465
- Yes what?

117
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,599
- Yes ma'am.

118
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,498
- Yes ma'am what?

119
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:23,332
- Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, three bags full.

120
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:24,699
(laughter)

121
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,865
- Enough, follow me.

122
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,465
- Don't you got some kid stuff to do?

123
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:50,665
- Yeah, honey, he's probably going to sleep all afternoon.

124
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:55,832
- Now look the main sail.

125
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:58,465
Taking the helm.

126
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:04,198
Pull in the slack, the spanker.

127
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:04,965
- Spank her?

128
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,799
I hardly know her.

129
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:08,332
- He's a master sailor.

130
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:10,898
You should give him more respect.

131
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,532
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

132
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:15,799
Spank it to me, baby.

133
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,498
(laughter)

134
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:21,065
- Molly. (coughing)

135
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:26,131
Get me some water, will you, babe?

136
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:30,565
Oh, thank you, dear, oh.

137
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:35,799
How's the river, huh?

138
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,198
- Water's up a little with all the rain.

139
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,031
- How's my house?

140
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:42,699
- Dad and I have been going through old boxes of stuff.

141
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,898
We have to auction off, Cappy,

142
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,865
because we don't have enough money to--

143
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:50,498
- Money, money, money.

144
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,866
You do believe in the treasure, don't you, Molly?

145
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,398
Your mother knew.

146
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:01,599
She knew it was there.

147
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:04,465
- She never found it, nobody has.

148
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:08,866
- Maybe it's time now for you to finish what she started.

149
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,165
It's your journey now.

150
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,599
- But Cappy.

151
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,532
- The river is, at night,

152
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:22,665
it mirrors clear sight.

153
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:26,532
Your story told,

154
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,298
of the soldier's gold.

155
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:31,665
- [Molly] Cappy.

156
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:34,365
- Time for your nap, Cappy.

157
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:41,298
- Faith, truth,

158
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,699
and courage.

159
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:55,865
(nostalgic piano music)

160
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:21,432
(whimsical music)

161
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,665
- [Jack] Hey, Molly, I mean Cap'n.

162
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:29,265
- [Molly] Is our science officer ready?

163
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,365
- In position, up the river.

164
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,265
- Or home watching Star Trek.

165
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,165
- [Molly] Helmets?

166
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:36,098
- Jack.

167
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,998
Helmets, check.

168
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,365
- Check.

169
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:41,765
- Thanks.

170
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:48,165
(whistling)

171
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,965
(banjo music)

172
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,365
- All head full.

173
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,332
- Next time, I'll look out and Jillian's pedaling.

174
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:09,165
(banjo music)

175
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,998
- Keep sharp lookout!

176
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,699
- Can't keep this up.

177
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:38,998
I need fuel.

178
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:46,832
Wow, Mom was wrong, these are good for you.

179
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,465
I'm Superman now.

180
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,898
- Jack, check the rope!

181
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:57,632
- Uh, Captain, the rope's off, again.

182
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:58,931
Over.

183
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,898
- We're slowing down!

184
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:05,565
(suspenseful music)

185
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,265
- I could use a drink.

186
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,165
Thanks.

187
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:16,665
- I can't believe it, every time!

188
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,931
Go fill up some water balloons.

189
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,165
- Fire!

190
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,065
(yelling muffled)

191
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:26,732
- [Voiceover] You need to cool off!

192
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,665
- I'm out of there in less than one hour.

193
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:36,665
Ha, beating my own record, with travel money.

194
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,031
- My ammo's gone!

195
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,532
- Engine room, we're running in for lunch.

196
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,098
- Twinkies?

197
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,465
- I'm hit, I'm hit!

198
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,065
- Yes!

199
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,865
- Matty coming.

200
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,699
- My ammo's gone!

201
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,965
- Jillian, raise the white flag!

202
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,198
- Looks like they're out of ammo!

203
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,898
- Hurry, before they--

204
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:32,065
Never mind.

205
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,998
(triumphant music)

206
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:45,031
- [Voiceover] Jack, do something!

207
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,031
- [Voiceover] Hal, I thought you had a plan.

208
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,799
They're killing us.

209
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,565
- Roger, Blue Leader, I copy.

210
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:01,432
- This battle stops, my cover's blown.

211
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:06,799
- Hey, the white flag's up!

212
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,065
Don't you know the kid's code of the river?

213
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:12,165
(laughter)

214
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,365
- Uh oh.

215
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,198
- [Voiceover] We like to sing, we like to dance,

216
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,865
we see Molly's underpants.

217
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:23,365
(laughter)

218
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,098
- [Voiceover] Hal, if you're gonna do something,

219
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:31,098
now would be a good time.

220
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:34,165
- Roger, Blue Leader, dropping on your 20, over.

221
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,965
- On my what? Over?

222
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,632
- If I were you, I'd duck.

223
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:42,832
(engines buzzing)

224
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,432
- What are you doing here, kid?

225
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:47,031
- Uh, I'm just trying to hide?

226
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:50,898
(engines buzzing)

227
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,998
- What's that?

228
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,832
- I would hide.

229
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:58,432
(engines buzzing) - Run!

230
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,098
- Couldn't have said it better, myself.

231
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:05,632
(engines buzzing)

232
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,732
- Here comes somebody's mom.

233
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,565
Boy, does she look mad!

234
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,998
- That's no mother, that's Evil's evil twin.

235
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,699
You gotta hide me.

236
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,398
Kids' code of the river?

237
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:26,098
- There's no kids' code of the river for you.

238
00:15:26,098 --> 00:15:28,998
You threw a water balloon at me when the white flag was up.

239
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,098
- Well, if they catch me, I'm downriver to Juvenile Hall.

240
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,532
In there?

241
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:41,298
- If you don't wanna get caught.

242
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:44,131
- But I can't swim.

243
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,865
- Better hurry.

244
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,398
- I hope there's no snakes.

245
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,599
This water's cold.

246
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:02,465
Oh my gosh.

247
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,265
- Simonton!

248
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,498
All right, children, where is he?

249
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,465
- Where is who?

250
00:16:16,465 --> 00:16:18,165
- Our recent arrival.

251
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:20,498
I know he's here, I heard voices.

252
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:23,165
- I think you heard our voices, ma'am.

253
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:26,332
- It's not safe out here for a young boy.

254
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:29,031
You can't trust that boy, you know.

255
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,398
He steals from everyone.

256
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,931
- He's a thief?

257
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,432
(yelling)

258
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:07,565
- You're only making this harder on yourself.

259
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:08,931
- Hey, don't hurt him.

260
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,465
- It's for his own good, dear.

261
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,265
- Everything checks out.

262
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,498
(dialing)

263
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:19,465
Except, where's Unit Seven?

264
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:20,498
- Come on.

265
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,131
- Not cold.

266
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,398
Not cold?

267
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:25,931
That water was freezing!

268
00:17:25,931 --> 00:17:30,298
(engines buzzing)

269
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,398
- Ah, kids, come on!

270
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:35,599
- [Voiceover] Bad hair day!

271
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:40,565
- Bad remote helicopter.

272
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,699
Bad, bad, bad.

273
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,699
- Oh the humanity!

274
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:54,165
And to think they pick on poor, helpless Twinkies.

275
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,799
Come to Papa.

276
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,365
- You're too old to be cute anymore.

277
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:03,965
10 years old, no parents, and a juvie to boot.

278
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:07,065
There are no more foster homes for you, mister.

279
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:10,265
You're an orphan with no prospects of ever having a family.

280
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:13,031
Get that into that thick little head of yours.

281
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:16,031
And if you ever run away again, I'll chain you to your bed.

282
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,665
Forever.

283
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:23,898
(mellow banjo music)

284
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:39,699
- [Molly] Hey, Dad.

285
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,898
Dr. Turner.

286
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:42,965
- Hello, Molly.

287
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:44,332
- What happened to you?

288
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,165
- You should see the other guys.

289
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:48,365
- We were just talking about your grandpa.

290
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,065
- The museum would like to purchase some things

291
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:52,098
before the auction.

292
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,398
- What things?

293
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,332
- Oh, any of your grandfather's Civil War relics.

294
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,732
Any of Sara's, your mother's research regarding the--

295
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,298
- The lost treasure?

296
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:03,165
- Did you ever see her diary, honey?

297
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:05,465
- We're willing to pay a nice price.

298
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:07,832
- Even if I did know where it was, it's not for sale.

299
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,532
- Molly, that's not polite.

300
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:12,232
- Dad, that belongs to us.

301
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:15,732
- Paul, maybe you and I should talk about this later.

302
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:18,799
- Okay, thanks, Louis.

303
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,765
- What was that all about?

304
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,832
- We can take the journey, Grandpa said.

305
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,232
- Where?

306
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:35,232
(inspirational music)

307
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,031
Your grandpa's not doing well.

308
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,065
He says some crazy things.

309
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,332
- I believe him.

310
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:41,765
We can take the boat, Dad.

311
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,699
- You're not going after any treasure, it's dangerous.

312
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:46,599
And besides, it's all just a story.

313
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,432
It's not true.

314
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:50,665
- Mom thought it was.

315
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,498
(melancholy music)

316
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:57,065
- Listen, young lady, no treasure hunt.

317
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,832
- If we found that treasure, we'd solve all our problems.

318
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,131
- Money doesn't solve problems.

319
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,632
Besides, I've already worked things out with the museum.

320
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,498
Dr. Turner will pay for those Civil War relics

321
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,865
of your grandfather's.

322
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,165
- Turner's a snake.

323
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,532
- You might as well know that snake

324
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,131
thinks he's found a buyer for this house.

325
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,198
- Dad, this is Grandpa's house.

326
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:19,131
- Even then, we still can't cover his medical costs.

327
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:21,465
He's been sick a long time.

328
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:24,098
- I won't leave the river.

329
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,898
- Molly!

330
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:35,098
(brushing teeth) (toilet flushing)

331
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,098
(loud radio blasting)

332
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:44,498
- Simonton, turn down the music!

333
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,031
(phone ringing)

334
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:52,765
- Where is she?

335
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,398
She's gotta be there.

336
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,732
Faulty wiring at the foster home.

337
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,398
Try again.

338
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:08,665
(phone ringing)

339
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:12,665
- White River Foster Care, Beatrice Rancette speaking.

340
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:15,998
Oh, hello Director.

341
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:18,031
Oh, yes sir.

342
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,931
- I'll be there in two days.

343
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,498
And I'm bringing Mr. Farr of White River paper.

344
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,799
- Oh, of course, yes sir.

345
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,998
Um, why the head of a paper company, sir?

346
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:31,298
- [Director] You just be sure everything is in good order.

347
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:33,532
No trouble, especially with the children.

348
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,632
- Oh, of course sir, absolutely.

349
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:37,632
Everything will be spit-spot.

350
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,298
(rock music)

351
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:50,898
Simonton!

352
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:52,832
- Yes, Nurse Rancid?

353
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,965
- Rancette, idiot.

354
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:02,332
More than I need to know, Simonton.

355
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:05,465
- Yes, Rancette.

356
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:09,198
- Look, the director is com--

357
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,532
Would you cover up, please?

358
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,031
The director is coming.

359
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:19,699
I want you to make sure there's no trouble,

360
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:22,765
especially, Alex, come with me!

361
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,799
- Yes Nurse Rancette.

362
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,699
- Oh sheets.

363
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,832
- Find him!

364
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:37,765
If there is anything, anything amiss here

365
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,532
when the director arrives--

366
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:41,532
- You'll probably lose your job.

367
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:45,799
- Yes, and if I lose my job, then what happens to you?

368
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,632
- Um, I get a raise?

369
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:51,298
- Oh shut up, you lose yours, too.

370
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,931
Now find that child!

371
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,298
- [Dad] Hey, you sure you don't want any dinner?

372
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,998
- Yeah.

373
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:01,998
Dad, we can't leave the river.

374
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:03,665
- A lot of kids move.

375
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,265
At least you'll have some great memories.

376
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:07,365
- Like you have memories of Mom?

377
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:08,265
- Of course.

378
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,065
- It's not the same, is it?

379
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:11,699
I miss her.

380
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:14,065
- Me too, honey.

381
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,699
Hard to believe we were married, we were so different.

382
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:19,565
- Treasure hunter and the teacher.

383
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,998
- Just the facts for me,

384
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:24,898
but she loved the wild tales of the river.

385
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:29,298
She devoted herself to searching for that treasure.

386
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:31,599
- Lost Treasure of White River?

387
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,865
- But when you were born, she stopped.

388
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:38,565
Seemed you were the only treasure she really needed.

389
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,565
- Dad!

390
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,765
We could do it, you and me.

391
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,599
We could finish what she started.

392
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,998
- Molly, stop, there's no documentation

393
00:23:46,998 --> 00:23:49,265
that the Army ever shipped gold on the river.

394
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:50,832
- Mom believed it, and Grandpa says

395
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:53,665
you have to have faith and stuff.

396
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,665
- You can't eat the things he's always spouting about.

397
00:23:56,665 --> 00:24:00,565
Faith, truth, courage.

398
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:04,265
And it won't put a roof over your head.

399
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,799
Anyway, I need to get to bed.

400
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:08,498
I've got a job interview in the city tomorrow.

401
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:09,998
It'll be okay.

402
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:15,799
Better get to sleep.

403
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,632
By the way, I loved your speech.

404
00:24:18,632 --> 00:24:21,198
Blaze of glory.

405
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:32,198
- [Cappy] In every journey, you've got to have three things,

406
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:35,265
faith, truth, courage.

407
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,232
Oh, and a little bit of luck.

408
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:41,732
- [Molly] That's four, faith, truth, courage, and luck.

409
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,832
- [Cappy] Well, you can't count on luck.

410
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:50,865
Believe in yourself, believe in the river.

411
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:55,365
And oh. (laughter)

412
00:24:56,632 --> 00:24:58,098
Yessir.

413
00:24:58,098 --> 00:25:00,098
- [Molly] Wow.

414
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:07,065
- When you start your journey, remember the legend.

415
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:09,765
- The legend?

416
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:13,198
- Indians used to tell a story about a spirit bear

417
00:25:13,198 --> 00:25:15,699
that watched over the river.

418
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:19,165
It was a great big, old, mean bear.

419
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:22,332
Three toes.

420
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:24,565
- Is he mad about something?

421
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,332
- I don't know, it was a legend.

422
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:29,265
But they say that he was the guardian

423
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,898
of the river's treasures.

424
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,832
- I'd be too scared to go against that big bear.

425
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:38,765
There's no way, right, Cappy?

426
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:43,765
- Now, just remember, faith, truth, and courage.

427
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:55,165
(electronic screeches)

428
00:25:55,165 --> 00:26:00,031
(rattling cans)

429
00:26:10,665 --> 00:26:12,965
- [Voiceover] So let it be.

430
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:17,865
(electronic screeches) (rattling cans)

431
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:19,699
- Who's there?

432
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:23,065
(electronic screeches)

433
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,031
Hal?

434
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:26,398
- Greetings, Captain.

435
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,565
- [Molly] Are you okay?

436
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,432
- Neuromuscular 63%.

437
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,898
Vision, system failure.

438
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:35,565
- [Molly] What were you wearing?

439
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:37,165
- Night vision goggles.

440
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:39,031
This was the test run.

441
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,265
You can see in the dark.

442
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,165
(electronic screeches)

443
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,465
Sorta.

444
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:45,265
- Wait, say that again.

445
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:46,465
- Sorta?

446
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:49,365
- No, the part about seeing in the dark.

447
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:52,532
- Well, technically, they reflect

448
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,799
off the charged-coupled device.

449
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,332
- That's it, seeing in the dark.

450
00:26:58,332 --> 00:27:01,232
River at night, mirrors clear as sight.

451
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:03,865
Your story told, the soldier's gold.

452
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:06,065
- That's really not the technical description.

453
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:07,198
- It's a riddle!

454
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:09,098
It's a clue to finding the treasure.

455
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:11,799
We have to find it, Hal, we have to.

456
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,565
It's the only way I can stay on the river

457
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,432
and save Grandpa's house.

458
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,665
(clunking)

459
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:18,866
Sh.

460
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:23,865
(dog barking) (electronic screeching)

461
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:37,599
(yelling)

462
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,898
- [Molly] You, what are you doing here?

463
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:44,931
- [Hal] Hey, navigational charts of the river.

464
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,465
- [Molly] My mom's research!

465
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,365
What are you doing in here?

466
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,298
- I just want to talk about your boat.

467
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,065
- [Molly] What about my boat?

468
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:55,699
- I just want to go downriver, a few miles,

469
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,031
and then I'd--

470
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,432
- [Molly] Steal my boat.

471
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,165
That's what you're trying to do.

472
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:04,298
- Nah, borrow it, come on.

473
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:07,599
- And just how were you planning to return it?

474
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,265
- Well, I'd...

475
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:13,898
- That's it, out, and stay off my boat.

476
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:14,965
- Sure, whatever.

477
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:17,898
- Hold it, what's that?

478
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,532
- Here.

479
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,198
Not bad reading once you get past the buried treasure parts.

480
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:26,765
- What is it?

481
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:28,332
- It's my mom's diary.

482
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:33,098
(nostalgic piano music)

483
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:37,565
They were clobbering us when Jillian raised the white flag.

484
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,965
It turned out to be a big pair of ladies' underwear.

485
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,332
- [Cappy] Oh, how'd those get in there?

486
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:46,031
- Then, my life, as I knew it, was over.

487
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:49,865
- Oh, I said the same thing when your grandmother

488
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:52,298
bought them drawers.

489
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:56,632
- And then they all started singing.

490
00:28:56,632 --> 00:29:00,599
- Big underwear can have that effect on people.

491
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,265
Help you sir?

492
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:06,465
- Yes, I've come to visit Jacob Bradshaw.

493
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,765
Is this his room?

494
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:10,432
- Yeah, his granddaughter's in there with him.

495
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:15,232
- I found Mom's diary.

496
00:29:15,232 --> 00:29:18,699
She was closer to finding the treasure than anybody knew.

497
00:29:18,699 --> 00:29:20,165
And there's a map.

498
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:22,098
Mom's diary says there's someone named Bert

499
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:24,865
that can help us.

500
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:28,198
We can make it in a day, you and me, Cappy.

501
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:31,232
- I'm afraid not, Molly.

502
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,465
I'm just so tired.

503
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:34,998
- I can't go without you.

504
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:37,532
- The river at night. - [Molly] Cappy.

505
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:41,398
- Soldier's gold. - [Molly] Cappy.

506
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,198
- I'm just so tired, Sara.

507
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,298
- Cappy, Cappy?

520
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,498
That old eyesore of a foster home gone.

521
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:52,298
The old Jacob Bradshaw house gone.

522
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:54,732
Hello, White River Papers.

523
00:30:54,732 --> 00:30:57,398
Now, if I could just get my hands on that diary.

524
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:04,298
- Now what would they want with some old motor,

525
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,998
silly children.

526
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:09,398
You'd think they were going on some kind of cruise.

527
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:16,232
- [Molly] Come on, Jack, try it again.

528
00:31:18,165 --> 00:31:21,765
(motor starting and sputtering out)

529
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,765
- Hal, can't you program something to make this work?

530
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:26,799
- If only it had an EEPROM.

531
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,165
Without the additional power,

532
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:31,532
our journey will be severely curtailed.

533
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:32,965
- What'd he say?

534
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:35,165
- We can't go.

535
00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:38,665
- I'll never get downriver to find Bert.

536
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,065
- [Voiceover] Hello, Mr. Brown.

537
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,898
This is White River Nursing Home.

538
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:45,065
I'm calling about your father-in-law,

539
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,599
and we wanted to make sure Molly was all right.

540
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,599
Well, call us as soon as you get this message, please.

541
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:55,632
- Uh, uh, uh, Molly.

542
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:00,065
There's somebody in there.

543
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:05,665
- Hi.

544
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,332
- You again, don't you ever give up?

545
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,298
- [Jillian] It's that delinquent kid.

546
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:12,298
- Alex, name's Alex.

547
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,098
Well, I just want a ride out of here.

548
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:16,665
I can help, you know.

549
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:19,332
- [Molly] I suppose you know something about motors?

550
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,799
- Well, one of the loving foster homes I was in

551
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,165
was with this mechanic, a real prince.

552
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:29,432
I had to work in his garage or else no bed, no food.

553
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:34,532
You pick up stuff.

554
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:38,732
(light piano music)

555
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:45,198
- [Jillian] Okay, sleeping bags, check.

556
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:46,298
Food?

557
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,632
- Affirmative.

558
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,298
Highly adequate, proteinaceous sustenance.

559
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:52,865
- What did he say?

560
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,265
- He's got the food.

561
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:55,398
- Oh.

562
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:57,198
- Parental consent, accounted for?

563
00:32:57,198 --> 00:32:59,599
- Check, all of your parents think you're at my house.

564
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,332
And my dad's away at a job interview.

565
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:04,765
- Except for...

566
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:08,832
- No worries, I don't have any parents.

567
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:10,699
- No worries, you're not going.

568
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,565
We can't risk that woman coming after us.

569
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:13,632
Thanks for the help.

570
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,832
But sorry, Alex.

571
00:33:16,665 --> 00:33:19,632
- I'm gonna be grounded for life if my mom finds out

572
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:22,498
we're not sleeping at your house, Molly.

573
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:27,165
- GPS navigation system, Hal 9000 patent pending?

574
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:29,432
- [Voiceover] Hello, how are you?

575
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:31,699
- Check.

576
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:34,465
- [Jillian] Gas can?

577
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,765
- Check, and, uh, negative.

578
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,565
- What?

579
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:46,232
Great, this wrecks everything.

580
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,998
- [Alex] I know where some is.

581
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,432
- Where?

582
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:51,131
- There.

583
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,998
- Great, do we knock first, or ring the bell?

584
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,465
- Neither.

585
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,298
They'd never think I'm stupid enough to break back in.

586
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,998
- Isn't that stealing?

587
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:05,665
- I gave them the best 59 minutes and 20 seconds of my life.

588
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:08,532
Think of it as a trade.

589
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:11,665
- I'll go, you stay here.

590
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:16,165
- You know, technically, if we get caught, we're done.

591
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:17,965
Need these, Molly?

592
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:19,799
- [Jillian and Molly] No.

593
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:22,832
- [Hal] Just made a few minor adjustments.

594
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:26,699
(electronic pulses)

595
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,532
- Oh brother.

596
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,965
(dog barking) (suspenseful music)

597
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:35,465
- Stay here.

598
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:07,198
- Yes, Nurse Rancette.

599
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,732
Who's a good doggie.

600
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:14,765
You're a good doggie, yes you are.

601
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:18,732
(snoring)

602
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:20,365
(thudding)

603
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:27,065
This dream, oh, we were married this time.

604
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:30,298
Rancette babies.

605
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:33,432
Terminal bad hair, oh.

606
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:42,131
(suspenseful music) (barking)

607
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:54,365
- Let me have it.

608
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:56,765
- You don't take me with you, no gas.

609
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:59,498
- Fine, promise no more stealing.

610
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:00,498
- I promise.

611
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:01,298
- What?

612
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,232
- I promise!

613
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,799
- Sh.

614
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:07,765
- What is it now?

615
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:13,866
- Who's there?

616
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,799
- What's going on out there?

617
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:21,165
- I thought I heard someone, Nurse Rancid.

618
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:24,432
- Rancette, Simonton.

619
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,365
- I'm sorry, Nurse Rancette.

620
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,332
- Bed check, immediately.

621
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:36,098
What's that smell?

622
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,265
- What's the smell, let's see, it's you, Nurse Rancid.

623
00:36:54,465 --> 00:36:56,865
- That smell was gas!

624
00:36:56,865 --> 00:37:00,265
The kids, the motor, oh Simonton!

625
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,165
- [Jillian] They got caught, I just know it.

626
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,532
- [Jack] We're in big trouble.

627
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:08,665
- They've been gone approximately...

628
00:37:08,665 --> 00:37:11,632
- [Voiceover] 13 minutes, seven seconds.

629
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,065
- Too long.

630
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:17,898
(mellow piano music)

631
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:26,965
- Honey, I'm home.

632
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:28,065
Slip me some skin.

633
00:37:28,065 --> 00:37:29,765
- All right.

634
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,565
- Okay, let's shove off.

635
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:36,765
- It's all clear now, he's been hiding on that boat.

636
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,065
- Why would he do that?

637
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:39,532
- Because he's going downriver

638
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:41,498
with the rest of the children.

639
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:44,198
They must all be running away.

640
00:37:51,866 --> 00:37:55,765
- Enemy approaching, and boy, does she look mad.

641
00:37:57,098 --> 00:37:58,599
Or not. (electronic screeches)

642
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:01,398
Hal, I thought you fixed these.

643
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:07,765
(mystical music)

644
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,498
- Yes, this is Louis Turner.

645
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:27,131
Paul, I was in the area and I thought we could talk.

646
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:29,232
I'll try back later.

647
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:33,998
(mystical music)

648
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,532
- Nothing, the boat's gone.

649
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:49,232
- Jack, the motor will make noise.

650
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:57,365
- By my calculations, sound travels at 620 feet per second.

651
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:01,332
- Oh, the director's gonna have my head for this.

652
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:03,298
- Yes, Nurse Rancid, your head.

653
00:39:03,298 --> 00:39:04,832
- Rancette.

654
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:06,065
Oh, shut up.

655
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:09,265
Call the sheriff, call the sheriff.

656
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,165
If my home isn't good enough for that boy,

657
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,732
maybe the big house will be.

658
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:16,198
- Stop it!

659
00:39:18,365 --> 00:39:20,866
- [Molly] Okay, Jack, start the motor.

660
00:39:21,198 --> 00:39:23,298
- Okay, got it.

661
00:39:23,298 --> 00:39:28,198
(motor running and sputtering out)

662
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,498
Not good.

663
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:35,498
- Looks like we risked a criminal record for nothing.

664
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,131
- Try it now.

665
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,599
(motor running)

666
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,832
Don't panic.

667
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:55,498
- Great job.

668
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:57,599
Now we just need to figure out our coordinates.

669
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,432
- [Voiceover] Hello, I'm Hal 9000.

670
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,699
Nice to meet you.

671
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,298
We are now docking into Earth orbit nine,

672
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:07,565
(Spanish speaking)

673
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:11,732
- Perfect, we're headed in the right direction.

674
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,732
- Everything okay, Nurse Rancette?

675
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:21,532
- Oh, hello, Dr. Turner.

676
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:25,765
Just one small problem, one of our boys has run away.

677
00:40:25,765 --> 00:40:28,799
- Yeah, and he stole my wallet.

678
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,832
- We believe he's headed downriver as we speak

679
00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:34,398
with that awful bunch of river rats on their homemade boat.

680
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,665
- You mean Molly?

681
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:37,131
They're on Molly's boat?

682
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:41,398
- Yes, we saw them making ready for some kind of journey.

683
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,599
- Did they, do you know where they were going?

684
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,832
- No, but clearly they planned all along

685
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:49,632
to spirit away the boy. - [Simonton] Thief.

686
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:51,498
- We were just about the call the sheriff.

687
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,665
- Nurse Rancette.

688
00:40:56,098 --> 00:41:00,031
- Beatrice, call me Beatrice.

689
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:04,365
- Beatrice, and you must call me Louis.

690
00:41:04,365 --> 00:41:06,498
Why don't I help you run downriver?

691
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:10,098
I'm sure that we could intercept them at the first bridge.

692
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,998
Molly's father is a friend of mine,

693
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:17,398
and I'd hate to see them get into any trouble.

694
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:18,732
- And if we found them first,

695
00:41:18,732 --> 00:41:21,198
we wouldn't have to tell the director about it.

696
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:25,866
- Oh, uh, well, I wouldn't want poor Mr. Brown

697
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:29,365
to experience any difficulties.

698
00:41:29,365 --> 00:41:34,098
Perhaps you're right, Louis. (giggles)

699
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:37,165
Get in, Simonton.

700
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:41,065
(running motor)

701
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,965
- I'm looking for it, I'm looking for it, all right?

702
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:47,565
- Look at your fly! (giggling)

703
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,332
- It's on my fly, it's on my fly.

704
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:55,931
It's like, it's like you put a big spotlight on me.

705
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:59,632
- Wait, I don't remember a big brown spot on my underwear.

706
00:41:59,632 --> 00:42:03,765
(laughter)

707
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:08,565
Spikes, wings, really weird things biting me.

708
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:11,198
(laughter)

709
00:42:19,898 --> 00:42:22,265
- Molly, I'm trying to verify coordinates.

710
00:42:22,265 --> 00:42:24,432
What's that rhyme?

711
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:28,699
- The river at night, mirrors clear as sight.

712
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:31,931
Your story told, the soldier's gold.

713
00:42:32,866 --> 00:42:34,898
- Gold?

714
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:37,365
What gold?

715
00:42:37,832 --> 00:42:39,232
- Never mind.

716
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:42,398
Get to sleep, I'll take first watch.

717
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,998
We have to stay in the middle of the river.

718
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:56,098
(suspenseful music)

719
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,265
- Night, honey.

720
00:43:13,198 --> 00:43:17,931
(whimsical music)

721
00:43:22,198 --> 00:43:25,265
- GPS, what direction are we headed?

722
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:28,732
- [Voiceover] 24 (Spanish language)

723
00:43:28,732 --> 00:43:31,465
- That's not right, is it?

724
00:43:31,465 --> 00:43:34,031
- [Voiceover] Five seven five latitude.

725
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:37,065
- I must have mixed programs in the download.

726
00:43:37,065 --> 00:43:40,965
Spanish translator with global positioning.

727
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:44,799
- [Voiceover] Your direction is 2 (Spanish language)

728
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:46,432
- What does that mean?

729
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,732
- Your fly's open.

730
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:50,732
- it is not.

731
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,998
- Made you look.

732
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:03,931
(upbeat music)

733
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:21,065
(snoring)

734
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:27,498
- Oh, oh, Louis, I'm so sorry, oh how rude of me.

735
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:31,031
- It's quite all right, Beatrice.

736
00:44:31,031 --> 00:44:33,632
Now, where's Simonton?

737
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:38,599
(whimsical music) (snoring)

738
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:42,632
- Simonton!

739
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:45,298
(yelling) (crashing)

740
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:49,699
- Did they pass here, yet?

741
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,599
- Not that I noticed.

742
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,599
- Oh you idiot, they're probably far ahead by now.

743
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,699
- I have an idea.

744
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,165
(phone dialing)

745
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:03,065
Mr. Farr, yes, this is Louis Turner.

746
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:05,432
Yes, hello.

747
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:07,931
We're very close, but I wanna make sure

748
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:09,898
that a certain little girl and her friends

749
00:45:09,898 --> 00:45:13,332
don't find something that could

750
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:15,599
prove fortunate for them and unfortunate

751
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,232
for the White River Papers.

752
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:21,532
In a word sir, I need a boat.

753
00:45:22,998 --> 00:45:26,931
Excellent, you'll be signing the papers by the weekend.

754
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,065
- That's a coincidence, Louis.

755
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:32,699
The president of the White River Papers

756
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,532
is to be a the foster home in two days.

757
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:39,732
- Yes, life is strange, isn't it, Beatrice?

758
00:45:41,898 --> 00:45:43,998

No, not here.

Well, I can't say that I've ridden in anything

Oh!

807
00:49:21,832 --> 00:49:24,131

810
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:44,732
- [Jack] I'm starving, how about lunch?

811
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,298
- Yes, protein would be nice.

812
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:53,165
What's that?

813
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:55,599
- Hey, what's going on?

814
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:57,265
Jillian, the ropes!

815
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:59,265
Cut the motor, we're breaking up!

816
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,232
- We're about to get boarded.

817
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,998
What do you want?

818
00:50:02,998 --> 00:50:04,832
- I think they're human.

819
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:06,865
- I think they're teenagers.

820
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:10,265
- Great, that's all we need, teenagers.

821
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:11,665
- Whaddya got?

822
00:50:11,665 --> 00:50:13,599
- [Molly] Nothin' really.

823
00:50:14,832 --> 00:50:16,931
- Then I guess we're just gonna have to take your boat.

824
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,131
- I don't like this.

825
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:21,398
- Hey, look.

826
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:22,931
- Hey, give those back.

827
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,665
- Just give them the stupid Twinkies, Jack.

828
00:50:25,665 --> 00:50:27,332
- Look, beans.

829
00:50:27,332 --> 00:50:30,532
- By my calculations, there are five of us,

830
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,665
and 20 of them.

831
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:33,832
- [Jillian] Jack.

832
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:36,632
- You don't know how painful this is.

833
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,498
- [Voiceover] You're not going anywhere.

834
00:50:41,898 --> 00:50:43,632
- Hands off, creep.

835
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:46,632
(roaring)

836
00:50:46,632 --> 00:50:48,532
- That sounded like a bear.

837
00:50:48,532 --> 00:50:51,532
(roaring)

838
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,465
Can bears climb ropes?

839
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:04,865
- So, I don't think is just some fun on the water.

840
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:06,165
For Molly to take off like this after Cappy's--

841
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:07,665
(phone ringing)

842
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:09,298
- You might be right.

843
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:10,898
Sheriff Donnelly.

844
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,465
Right.

845
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:17,131
So, neither the groundskeeper nor the head nurse are there?

846
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:19,832
I see.

847
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:21,532
All right, thanks.

848
00:51:21,532 --> 00:51:22,665
Seems we got a kid missing, too.

849
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,131
Alex, new arrival.

850
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:26,165
- Maybe they're all in this together somehow.

851
00:51:26,165 --> 00:51:28,365
Molly's got this idea about a treasure.

852
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:30,732
- Yeah, I've heard that story since I was a kid.

853
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:32,665
That's what Cappy said,

854
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:35,065
"You have to have faith to find your truth,

855
00:51:35,065 --> 00:51:36,198
"and the courage to follow it,"

856
00:51:36,198 --> 00:51:37,332
is that it?

857
00:51:37,332 --> 00:51:38,965
- Yeah, but she really believes it,

858
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,232
and I think she may be desperate enough

859
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:42,765
to do something dangerous.

860
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:53,799
- [Voiceover] A witch! (yelling)

861
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,465
- Would you quit that noise, please?

862
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:04,965
- She's very polite, for a witch.

863
00:52:04,965 --> 00:52:06,998
- Ridiculous child.

864
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,465
- That it, no evil spells?

865
00:52:09,465 --> 00:52:11,665
No fire coming out your nose?

866
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:14,031
- Was that you that made that bear noise?

867
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,465
- It's bear country.

868
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,198
I could tell you stories.

869
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:20,031
Best be on your way.

870
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,031
- [Molly] Bert?

871
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:24,465
- Yeah, how do you know me?

872
00:52:24,465 --> 00:52:26,198
- You're Bert?

873
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:29,265
- Hm, short for Roberta.

874
00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:30,532
And now you kids better get,

875
00:52:30,532 --> 00:52:32,832
before those bad boys come back.

876
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:36,632
- But Bert, I'm Sara's daughter, Molly.

877
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,098
- Sara?

878
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:40,699
- Yes, I need to know the story of the treasure.

879
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,365
Cappy's been sick and we had to sell everything.

880
00:52:43,365 --> 00:52:46,898
And move from the weather, and Cappy--

881
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,398
- Hey Molly, what's wrong?

882
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:51,398
- Molly?

883
00:52:51,398 --> 00:52:53,232
- I see.

884
00:52:53,232 --> 00:52:55,065
You come ashore.

885
00:52:55,065 --> 00:52:58,599
The rest of you stay put, there's bears.

886
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:00,131
- How do you know?

887
00:53:00,131 --> 00:53:04,865
- Same way I know lots of stuff, I'm old, you brat.

888
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:09,865
(guitar music)

889
00:53:12,998 --> 00:53:16,998
(motorboat engine)

890
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:19,799
- Keep your eyes peeled, Paul.

891
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:20,931
We'll get there in time.

892
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,298
- [Paul] Can't you go any faster?

893
00:53:22,298 --> 00:53:26,632
(guitar music)

894
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,599
- You look like your mother.

895
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:37,532
- [Molly] I do?

896
00:53:37,532 --> 00:53:41,298
- Yeah, scruffy and earnest,

897
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:43,498
and pretty, too.

898
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:44,699
- Thanks.

899
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:49,131
- So, her father, your grandpa, huh?

900
00:53:49,131 --> 00:53:50,732
- Gone.

901
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:53,365
- Oh well, that's too bad, huh.

902
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,498
Huh?

903
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:58,599
- What?

904
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:02,699
- All right, you wanna hear the story I told your mother?

905
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:06,498
- Yes, please.

906
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,998
- Did you know that your great-great grandma

907
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,365
had the treasure in her hand in 1864?

908
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:17,498
- No, really?

909
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:21,165
- Sure, strong women run in your family.

910
00:54:21,165 --> 00:54:24,765
I'll tell ya, it wasn't long ago

911
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,298
that the terrible war between the states

912
00:54:26,298 --> 00:54:29,232
was just about over.

913
00:54:30,065 --> 00:54:32,732
It was a time of great desperation for the troops

914
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:35,998
as they prepared for one last battle.

915
00:54:35,998 --> 00:54:38,465
Your great-great grandma was a doctor there.

916
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:40,965
Pretty rare in those days.

917
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:43,599
- Wow, she was cool.

918
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,031
- Yeah, a lot like you, kiddo.

919
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:48,599
As night fell, a guard brought up

920
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:51,898
a wounded prisoner for treatment.

921
00:54:53,865 --> 00:54:56,832
The gold was the last hope for the wounded.

922
00:54:56,832 --> 00:55:00,298
It could buy badly needed food and medicine.

923
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:05,699
As the prisoner approached, he saw the gold,

924
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:09,031
and he got some high hopes of his own.

925
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:14,532
With a battle upon him, the prisoner decided

926
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:17,532
to make his move for that gold.

927
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:23,898
There was a struggle.

928
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:26,866
The prisoner got the gun.

929
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:29,832
Shots rang out.

930
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:35,265
He left with the gun and the gold.

931
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,998
And now, your great-great grandma was wounded,

932
00:55:37,998 --> 00:55:41,498
along with the others in the tent.

933
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:44,198
- So, what happened?

934
00:55:44,198 --> 00:55:46,732
- Well, the trooper made his way down river

935
00:55:46,732 --> 00:55:48,865
and was hiding the gold.

936
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:53,398
They say greed's always afraid to show its true face.

937
00:55:54,298 --> 00:55:58,031
Many men suffered because he stole that gold,

938
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:00,632
but there's a legend about the spirit bear

939
00:56:00,632 --> 00:56:02,432
that guards the river,

940
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:05,799
and sees to it that justice is done.

941
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:09,632
And that night, that prisoner met justice.

942
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,432
- [Molly] The three-toed bear?

943
00:56:12,965 --> 00:56:15,298
- That's right, missy.

944
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,898
You afraid, girl?

945
00:56:18,898 --> 00:56:20,832
Can't be afraid.

946
00:56:20,832 --> 00:56:24,165
Who knows what happened to that trooper?

947
00:56:24,165 --> 00:56:26,398
He didn't have the courage to face that bear

948
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:28,799
after what he'd done.

949
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:33,031
The prisoner and the gold were never seen again.

950
00:56:34,498 --> 00:56:36,332
- [Molly] Is there a map?

951
00:56:36,398 --> 00:56:38,532
- Well, I don't know, child.

952
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:45,198
I never had a map, myself. (creaking wood)

953
00:56:45,198 --> 00:56:49,131
It's how come I never went after the treasure myself.

954
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:54,332
- Uh, hi.

955
00:56:54,332 --> 00:56:56,998
- [Bert] What you doing here, sneaky boy?

956
00:56:57,065 --> 00:56:59,298
- Molly, we were just worried about you.

957
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:00,599
- [Molly] I'm fine.

958
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:03,332
- There's nothin' for you to pinch here, kid.

959
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,799
- [Molly] How did you know?

960
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,498
Alex promised he wouldn't steal anymore.

961
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:10,998
- I, uh, I was in your shed, Molly.

962
00:57:12,665 --> 00:57:14,232
I wanted to return it.

963
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,998
It was tucked in your mom's diary.

964
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:17,198
It's some kind of map.

965
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:18,799
- You stole it?

966
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,031
- Indeed it is, lookit.

967
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:25,031
This little island called Little Sue's is marked.

968
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:27,265
- Can you tell us how to get there?

969
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:29,065
- Sure, but,

970
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:33,131
I tell you who else is probably there.

971
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:34,832
- Three-toed bear.

972
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:38,365
I'm scared.

973
00:57:38,365 --> 00:57:40,131
- You're in big trouble.

974
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:45,799
- It can be dangerous in there at night.

975
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:52,265
- [Jillian] Molly, do you think you can find this island?

976
00:57:52,265 --> 00:57:56,398
- [Molly] Yeah, but it means we can't get back today.

977
00:57:56,398 --> 00:57:58,465
- [Hal] Provisions, anyone?

978
00:57:58,465 --> 00:57:59,365
- What?

979
00:57:59,365 --> 00:58:01,998
- He means anybody hungry?

980
00:58:01,998 --> 00:58:04,498
- Beans, is that it?

981
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:06,098
That's lunch?

982
00:58:06,098 --> 00:58:07,965
That's all you brought?

983
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:11,098
- The bean, pound for pound, contains the most protein

984
00:58:11,098 --> 00:58:14,398
in the smallest package, and can be eaten safely

985
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:16,365
at any temperature.

986
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:19,599
- Great, now we're all gonna be gas-powered.

987
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,765
- And me without my Twinkies.

988
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:24,432
- Even I could go for a Twinkie right now.

989
00:58:24,432 --> 00:58:27,532
- Oh well, it's food.

990
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:34,298
- I think they must have taken the left fork back there.

991
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:36,498
- Now can you explain how the paper company

992
00:58:36,498 --> 00:58:38,265
comes into all of this?

993
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,998
- Patience, my dear.

994
00:58:39,998 --> 00:58:43,665
You might receive a very nice payoff with a little patience.

995
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:45,265
(farting)

996
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:47,131
- Made some more space.

997
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:48,465
- [Hal] Is that confirmed,

998
00:58:48,465 --> 00:58:51,931
that there are bears in this area?

999
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:55,799
- Um, bears?

1000
00:58:58,898 --> 00:59:02,298
- Lions and tigers and bears!

1001
00:59:02,298 --> 00:59:04,365
- So funny, I forgot to laugh.

1002
00:59:04,365 --> 00:59:06,765
- But you didn't forget to pee your pants.

1003
00:59:06,765 --> 00:59:07,965
Made you look.

1004
00:59:07,965 --> 00:59:10,131
- Would you quit doing that?

1005
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:12,332
- Hal, didn't you think that with all these beans--

1006
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,765
(farting) Whoops.

1007
00:59:15,765 --> 00:59:18,799
- I never thought girls-- (farting)

1008
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,332
- The average person, male or female,

1009
00:59:21,332 --> 00:59:24,498
breaks wind 16 times a day.

1010
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:27,298
- [Alex] You mean (farting) per minute.

1011
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,832
- [Voiceover] A common by-product of bean consumption

1012
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,465
by humans. (farting)

1013
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:32,998
- [Hal] Anything is possible.

1014
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:37,365
- [Alex] In the land of (farting) Fartzilla!

1015
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,765
- [Hal] Now that's going to leave a mark.

1016
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:42,931
- Right.

1017
00:59:42,931 --> 00:59:44,732
They think they saw the hulk of a homemade boat

1018
00:59:44,732 --> 00:59:46,298
a couple of hours ago.

1019
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:47,865
- How much further can we go by boat?

1020
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:49,532
- Well, quite a ways till the dam.

1021
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:51,298
Indians used to call it Wapahoni.

1022
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:52,498
- Wapahoni?

1023
00:59:52,498 --> 00:59:54,265
- Yeah, it's the Indian word for mini falls.

1024
00:59:54,265 --> 00:59:55,799
- There's no chance they'll get that close to the dam,

1025
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:56,998
right?

1026
00:59:56,998 --> 00:59:59,699
- Well, let's find them before they find it.

1027
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:04,198
(motor starting)

1028
01:00:07,398 --> 01:00:11,799
(gentle music)

1029
01:00:15,198 --> 01:00:16,498
- [Alex] What's up with you?

1030
01:00:16,498 --> 01:00:17,898
- [Molly] Nothin'.

1031
01:00:19,065 --> 01:00:20,998
Really, nothing.

1032
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:24,031
Cappy died.

1033
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:26,965
- [Alex] Oh, I'm sorry.

1034
01:00:26,965 --> 01:00:29,365
- [Molly] So, that'll just leave me and my dad.

1035
01:00:29,365 --> 01:00:31,965
And if we have to move and leave the river,

1036
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,498
I won't have a home or

1037
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:38,398
my friends, and eveything will change.

1038
01:00:38,398 --> 01:00:42,832
- [Alex] I guess that leaves me and you in the same boat.

1039
01:00:42,832 --> 01:00:44,699
I'm sorry I stole that map.

1040
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:46,699
- That's all right, you gave it back.

1041
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:49,732
And besides, I still don't even know where we're going.

1042
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:50,931
And once we get there,

1043
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:53,965
I don't know how to find the treasure.

1044
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:56,131
And, there's a legend about a three-toed bear

1045
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:59,532
that'll eat you alive if you're afraid.

1046
01:01:01,165 --> 01:01:04,565
- Well, that leaves you out.

1047
01:01:06,332 --> 01:01:08,931
I've never met anybody as brave as you.

1048
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:09,832
- Really?

1049
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,198
- Mhmm.

1050
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:14,898
So, I'm with you to the island,

1051
01:01:14,898 --> 01:01:18,699
to the treasure, up against the bear.

1052
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:21,131
Proud to serve, Captain.

1053
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:22,799
- Thanks, Alex.

1054
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,898
- But right now, I gotta go.

1055
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:26,232
- You goin' someplace.

1056
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:27,931
- I gotta go!

1057
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:29,365
- Just go over the side.

1058
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:31,931
- No, I gotta go.

1059
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:49,799
(ominous music)

1060
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:55,265
(roaring)

1061
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:00,865
- You're short.

1062
01:02:00,865 --> 01:02:02,632
- Oh, that hurts.

1063
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:04,865
- What? - [Jillian] That really hurts.

1064
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,265
(growling)

1065
01:02:10,265 --> 01:02:13,098
- Bravest person in the world, ha.

1066
01:02:13,098 --> 01:02:15,765
Hey Alex, watch out for poison ivy!

1067
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:19,298
- What was that, two or three leaves?

1068
01:02:19,298 --> 01:02:23,632
(growling)

1069
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:25,398
Hello?

1070
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,365
(roaring)

1071
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:34,398
Okay, bye.

1072
01:02:34,832 --> 01:02:37,232
- [Cappy] Faith, truth, courage.

1073
01:02:37,232 --> 01:02:38,332
- [Alex] Bear!

1074
01:02:38,332 --> 01:02:39,799
- [Voiceover] Alert, big trouble.

1075
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:42,632
- [Alex] Bear, bear! (roaring)

1076
01:02:42,632 --> 01:02:44,665
- Come on!

1077
01:02:46,898 --> 01:02:48,599
- Come on you guys, quick! - [Jack] Come on, come on!

1078
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,465
- [Jack] Get on the boat, quick, there's a bear out there!

1079
01:02:57,965 --> 01:03:00,832
(growling)

1080
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,799
- Do you need to stop, Simonton?

1081
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:13,665
- Shouldn't be too hard to catch up with them.

1082
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,365
- I hope not.

1083
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:26,665
- [Jack] Okay, first the gas, then the beans,

1084
01:03:26,732 --> 01:03:30,898
then the gas, which came from the beans.

1085
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:33,265
Then a witch named Bert.

1086
01:03:33,265 --> 01:03:36,498
- Molly, that diary won't help us find the treasure.

1087
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:39,832
- And not to mention, the bad kids.

1088
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:41,732
I just wanna go home.

1089
01:03:41,732 --> 01:03:44,465
- But Cappy said, you have to have faith,

1090
01:03:44,465 --> 01:03:46,365
truth, and courage.

1091
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:50,065
- [Jack] Did Cappy ever say anything about Twinkies?

1092
01:03:50,065 --> 01:03:51,632
- [Molly] Jack!

1093
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,365
- Oh my God.

1094
01:03:59,165 --> 01:04:00,665
- What do you have there?

1095
01:04:00,665 --> 01:04:03,332
- Uh, nothing.

1096
01:04:03,332 --> 01:04:06,732
But I think we're hot on their trail, come on.

1097
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:24,365
- It can be dangerous out here at night.

1098
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:27,232
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

1099
01:04:32,031 --> 01:04:36,765
(peaceful orchestral music)

1100
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,532
- Can I see that?

1101
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:56,665
- Sure.

1102
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,098
I'm gonna do things when I grow up.

1103
01:04:58,098 --> 01:05:00,931
I'm not gonna have a boring job.

1104
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,599
I'm gonna, travel the Sierra,

1105
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,432
sail all the Seven Seas, and go to Mars.

1106
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:09,432
- [Jack] Don't you think you're already on Mars, Molly?

1107
01:05:11,232 --> 01:05:13,732
- Look what he's looking at.

1108
01:05:13,732 --> 01:05:18,732
(jeering)

1109
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:23,898
- [Molly] Jack, I know you like them, but just stop.

1110
01:05:24,365 --> 01:05:26,832
- There they are, finally.

1111
01:05:28,398 --> 01:05:30,632
Louis, did you see that sign?

1112
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:31,799
- What sign?

1113
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,365
- The sign about the (rushing water).

1114
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:39,065
- River at night, mirrors clear sight.

1115
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:41,232
- What's that sound?

1116
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:43,532
- Here our story told.

1117
01:05:43,532 --> 01:05:45,732
- [Voiceover] The medallion is highly protein.

1118
01:05:45,732 --> 01:05:49,498
And the medallion is the map.

1119
01:05:49,498 --> 01:05:50,998
- Wait!

1120
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:53,332
That's it, the medallion!

1121
01:05:53,332 --> 01:05:56,365
- I hear a roar.

1122
01:05:56,365 --> 01:05:58,065
- [Voiceover] You are moving in a--

1123
01:05:58,065 --> 01:05:59,198
- Dam!

1124
01:05:59,198 --> 01:06:01,198
Turn to shore!

1125
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:03,332
No, to shore!

1126
01:06:05,832 --> 01:06:08,065
Over side, now!

1127
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:30,931
- [Voiceover] Wow, I guess (words drowned out by crashing)

1128
01:06:30,931 --> 01:06:32,799
- Oh my goodness.

1129
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,699
Why don't we go pick them up?

1130
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,632
- Too late.

1131
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,765
- But Louis, did they all make it to shore?

1132
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:44,265
- That's what I'm worried about.

1133
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:46,298
- Where's Molly and Jillian?

1134
01:06:46,298 --> 01:06:50,965
- I, I don't think they made it.

1135
01:06:51,432 --> 01:06:53,165
- Come on.

1136
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:01,965
(suspenseful music)

1137
01:07:09,965 --> 01:07:12,865
- I'm going to go into that cove over there.

1138
01:07:13,898 --> 01:07:14,898
- [Molly] Are you okay?

1139
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,332
- [Jillian] Yeah.

1140
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:33,599
(new age music)

1141
01:07:33,732 --> 01:07:35,532
- Molly!

1142
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:37,632
Molly?

1143
01:07:39,498 --> 01:07:41,332
Molly!

1144
01:07:46,465 --> 01:07:48,765
Oh, sorry.

1145
01:07:50,998 --> 01:07:52,498
- Come on.

1146
01:07:56,898 --> 01:07:58,665
I'm sorry I got you in this.

1147
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:01,065
We lost the map, the boat.

1148
01:08:01,065 --> 01:08:03,732
We're cold, and it's dark.

1149
01:08:03,732 --> 01:08:06,865
- And don't forget, we lost all of our beans over the dam.

1150
01:08:06,865 --> 01:08:09,165
- Is your whole life food?

1151
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:10,931
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1152
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:12,632
We could have been killed.

1153
01:08:12,632 --> 01:08:14,998
We're alive, and--

1154
01:08:14,998 --> 01:08:17,332
- Well, we're waiting.

1155
01:08:17,332 --> 01:08:20,498
- We're alive, did I say that already?

1156
01:08:20,498 --> 01:08:22,198
- You're lucky you don't have parents,

1157
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,098
'cause mine are gonna kill me.

1158
01:08:24,098 --> 01:08:28,098
- I'm real lucky, Jack, real lucky.

1159
01:08:28,098 --> 01:08:33,098
- I just, I mean, sorry.

1160
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:34,931
- Wait a minute!

1161
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:37,699
The map, it's still around your neck!

1162
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:40,365
- It's not a map of the river, it's--

1163
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:43,131
- Of this island.

1164
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:47,699
And the markings indicate the location of the treasure.

1165
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:51,198
I'd say that we go right up this hill.

1166
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,799
- Let's go.

1167
01:08:58,198 --> 01:08:59,832
- Think there's any wild animals out here?

1168
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:01,632
- Of course not, Simonton.

1169
01:09:01,632 --> 01:09:03,031
Are there, Louis?

1170
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:05,031
- I'm gonna try to move quietly toward the young folks.

1171
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:06,532
I don't wanna scare them.

1172
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:09,599
- And I just wanna get my wallet back.

1173
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:13,498
And a slice of whatever it is you're into, Louis.

1174
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:14,832
- I don't know what you mean.

1175
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,365
- Sure you do.

1176
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:19,965
And if I don't get it, I blow the whistle on the whole deal.

1177
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:21,699
The fact that the paper mill's trying to buy up

1178
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,765
the Bradshaw property and the foster home

1179
01:09:23,765 --> 01:09:25,699
so they can put a paper mill on the river.

1180
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:27,332
And the fact that you're trying to steal the treasure

1181
01:09:27,332 --> 01:09:28,632
away from these kids.

1182
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:30,465
The whole deal.

1183
01:09:30,465 --> 01:09:31,632
- What?

1184
01:09:31,632 --> 01:09:32,799
Will somebody tell me what's going on?

1185
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,031
- Done.

1186
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:36,599
All right, everybody walk like a woodsman.

1187
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:38,799
I think they're up there.

1188
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:00,198
So, you know about the paper mill?

1189
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:01,732
- Everybody knows the paper company's

1190
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:03,732
wanted that stretch of land forever.

1191
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,165
And with Jacob Bradshaw in the nursing home,

1192
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:08,699
I could just see the vultures circling in.

1193
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:10,031
- Well, they'll have to sell now.

1194
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:11,799
Paul Brown's already agreed,

1195
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:15,232
and the foster home is next on the chopping block.

1196
01:10:15,232 --> 01:10:17,031
- What?

1197
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:31,098
(growling)

1198
01:10:40,965 --> 01:10:43,065
(coughing)

1199
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:48,031
- There should be a rock somewhere.

1200
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:53,765
- Uh, guys, look.

1201
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:55,232
A skull.

1202
01:10:55,232 --> 01:10:57,332
- We need a light.

1203
01:10:58,332 --> 01:11:01,632
- It's also a 60-decibel audible alarm.

1204
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,665
- Just the light, Hal.

1205
01:11:03,732 --> 01:11:05,532
- Wow.

1206
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,265
Gold, just like in the museum.

1207
01:11:14,665 --> 01:11:18,832
(growling)

1208
01:11:18,832 --> 01:11:22,165
- Look, cloth from the Civil War.

1209
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:26,065
- The treasure must be here.

1210
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:26,965
- [Jack] Let's keep digging.

1211
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:27,866
- [Alex] Hold it.

1212
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,198
- [Molly] It's Dr. Turner.

1213
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:32,031
- Miss Rancette, come back for me.

1214
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:37,031
(roarling) (yelling)

1215
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:41,398
- That's Molly, come on.

1216
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,931
- [Voiceover] Molly, come on!

1217
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:45,898
- [Alex] Molly, he's guarding the treasure,

1218
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:47,432
it's not worth it.

1219
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:51,599
- Don't you see, courage is the only way.

1220
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,232
I can do this.

1221
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:58,232
Faith.

1222
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:00,832
Truth.

1223
01:12:00,832 --> 01:12:03,065
Courage.

1224
01:12:04,665 --> 01:12:07,131
(growling)

1225
01:12:09,866 --> 01:12:12,198
(growling)

1226
01:12:29,898 --> 01:12:34,898
(ominous music)

1227
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:38,198
- [Molly] Help!

1228
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:42,565
(roaring)

1229
01:12:43,898 --> 01:12:48,398
(roaring)

1230
01:12:54,498 --> 01:12:57,699
(roaring)

1231
01:13:03,332 --> 01:13:07,998
(spooky music)

1232
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:16,931
- [Alex] Molly! Molly?

1233
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,165
Molly. Molly.

1234
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:27,465
- Here, in here.

1235
01:13:28,898 --> 01:13:30,432
Bear gone?

1236
01:13:30,432 --> 01:13:33,198
- [Alex] I hope so, my butt's sticking out.

1237
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:35,498
(laughing)

1238
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:36,832
Is that what I think it is?

1239
01:13:36,832 --> 01:13:38,998
- Yup, faith, truth, and,

1240
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,131
help me drag it out.

1241
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:08,165
- Okay, now for the piece of resistance.

1242
01:14:08,165 --> 01:14:09,632
- What?

1243
01:14:09,632 --> 01:14:12,398
- It's French for open the sucker.

1244
01:14:13,131 --> 01:14:14,532
- It's locked.

1245
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:17,398
- Get a big rock, and hit it.

1246
01:14:17,398 --> 01:14:20,131
- Very scientific, Hal.

1247
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:28,265
- One more, there.

1248
01:14:28,265 --> 01:14:32,866
(wondrous music)

1249
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:46,332
- We'll take over from here, kids.

1250
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:48,832
- Oh yeah? - [Simonton] Yeah.

1251
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,599
That's for taking my wallet.

1252
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:51,865
And now we'll be taking this,

1253
01:14:51,865 --> 01:14:54,131
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1254
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:55,565
- [Jack] Finders keepers.

1255
01:14:55,565 --> 01:15:00,031
- Yes, but we're the keepers and you're the weepers.

1256
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:03,131
Sadly, kids have no rights in this world, now do they?

1257
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,732
- Yeah, you...

1258
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:08,232
losers.

1259
01:15:08,298 --> 01:15:09,865
- [Alex] Where's Nurse Rancette?

1260
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:12,265
- On the beach, a-scared of bears.

1261
01:15:12,265 --> 01:15:13,632
- We'll tell everyone what happened.

1262
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:14,632
They'll believe us.

1263
01:15:14,632 --> 01:15:15,898
- No they won't.

1264
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:18,131
Nobody believes this treasure ever existed.

1265
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:19,532
- What about the paper mill?

1266
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:21,198
It'll destroy the river.

1267
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:22,832
- Survival of the fittest.

1268
01:15:22,832 --> 01:15:25,332
And I'll just take this and live quietly in,

1269
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:27,765
say, Las Vegas.

1270
01:15:27,765 --> 01:15:29,031
- [Sheriff] Maybe Sing Sing.

1271
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:30,632
- [Paul] Molly!

1272
01:15:30,632 --> 01:15:32,031
- Last time I checked, Louis,

1273
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:33,866
stealing from anybody was against the law.

1274
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:35,265
- [Jack] Got that right.

1275
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:36,799
- You kids all right?

1276
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:40,031
- Oh dear me, this is terrible.

1277
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:42,632
I'm gonna be out of a home and a job, too.

1278
01:15:42,632 --> 01:15:46,398
- Now you know what it feels like, Nurse Ran--

1279
01:15:46,398 --> 01:15:47,232
Rancette.

1280
01:15:47,232 --> 01:15:49,398
- It's Ran--

1281
01:15:49,398 --> 01:15:51,765
I'm sorry, Alex.

1282
01:15:51,765 --> 01:15:53,898
Simonton!

1283
01:15:53,898 --> 01:15:54,865
How could you?

1284
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:56,532
And Louis?

1285
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,931
Stealing from children.

1286
01:15:58,931 --> 01:16:01,799
- Both of you better stay right where you're at.

1287
01:16:01,799 --> 01:16:04,031
- I can't believe you left, I've been so worried about you.

1288
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,498
- Paul, you bring the kids and the nurse on down.

1289
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:08,198
Let's go, you two.

1290
01:16:08,198 --> 01:16:10,765
- But I didn't do anything.

1291
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:13,965
I have a Ph.D., I'll have you know.

1292
01:16:13,965 --> 01:16:16,865
- Fud, isn't that contagious?

1293
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:18,065
- Not where he's going.

1294
01:16:18,065 --> 01:16:19,498
Come on.

1295
01:16:21,365 --> 01:16:25,799
- By my calculations, there's 3000 coins in there.

1296
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:28,165
At $20 each,

1297
01:16:28,165 --> 01:16:31,532
that's $60,000.

1298
01:16:31,532 --> 01:16:33,565
- [Jillian] Won't the government take it back?

1299
01:16:33,565 --> 01:16:35,765
- I don't think so, river salvage laws.

1300
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:37,898
Something lost in the river's fair game.

1301
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:41,432
- I think we need to buy a foster home, too.

1302
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:45,031
To keep the paper mill from destroying the river.

1303
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:46,599
- Will we have enough?

1304
01:16:46,599 --> 01:16:48,031
- These coins are pure gold

1305
01:16:48,031 --> 01:16:49,599
and their historical value makes them worth

1306
01:16:49,599 --> 01:16:53,265
at least $500-1000 apiece, I'd say.

1307
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:56,065
- That's three million dollars!

1308
01:16:56,065 --> 01:16:58,565
- Oh wow. - [Molly] Whoa.

1309
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:01,131
- [Jack] We're all rich!

1310
01:17:04,865 --> 01:17:09,031
- So, can Alex stay with us?

1311
01:17:09,031 --> 01:17:11,898
- We'll see, honey, let's just get home.

1312
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:14,365
- That sounds good enough.

1313
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:17,931
- I'm getting too old for this.

1314
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:20,965
All I ever wanted was to have my own restaurant.

1315
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,665
I know a special way to cook tamales.

1316
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:26,065
- [Alex] Maybe I could make you, Beatrice.

1317
01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:28,165
- Oh, please call me Bea--

1318
01:17:29,432 --> 01:17:31,465
Thanks, Alex.

1319
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:33,432

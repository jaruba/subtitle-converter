00:00.350 --> 00:03.280
<v Announcer>Live from Wendy's apartment in New York,</v>

2
00:03.280 --> 00:05.961
it's "The Wendy Williams Show at Home."

3
00:05.961 --> 00:08.680
(upbeat music)

4
00:08.680 --> 00:11.966
Now, here's Wendy!

5
00:11.966 --> 00:14.286
(upbeat music)

6
00:14.286 --> 00:15.868
<v ->How you doin?</v>

7
00:15.868 --> 00:18.118
(laughing)

8
00:18.960 --> 00:19.890
Hi.

9
00:19.890 --> 00:22.750
So this is the way it's gonna be for quite some time,

10
00:22.750 --> 00:25.500
so might as well just get used to this.

11
00:25.500 --> 00:27.680
I'm in my apartment.

12
00:27.680 --> 00:30.190
You're gonna get one angle which is the angle that you see.

13
00:30.190 --> 00:33.670
There will be no virtual tours, no nothing.

14
00:33.670 --> 00:35.073
This is all my stuff.

15
00:36.080 --> 00:37.663
This is the mess that I am.

16
00:40.640 --> 00:42.140
How are you?

17
00:42.140 --> 00:43.623
How are you holding up?

18
00:45.020 --> 00:47.653
Governor Andrew Cuomo can do no wrong to me.

19
00:48.600 --> 00:50.710
I mean, he's easy on the eyes

20
00:50.710 --> 00:54.120
and he explains things really, really simplistically.

21
00:54.120 --> 00:55.543
I like him a whole lot.

22
00:56.520 --> 00:59.320
Shout out to all the medical workers and the police and.

23
01:03.660 --> 01:05.100
Norman.

24
01:05.100 --> 01:06.500
Michael Lee's done it again.

25
01:07.471 --> 01:09.510
(laughing)

26
01:09.510 --> 01:11.330
Only reason why I'm not masking in the house

27
01:11.330 --> 01:12.820
is because where am I supposed to get it

28
01:12.820 --> 01:15.140
if I'm staying in the house?

29
01:15.140 --> 01:17.150
I'm not going anywhere.

30
01:17.150 --> 01:18.120
I mean, even right now,

31
01:18.120 --> 01:20.780
is there anybody at your house right now?

32
01:20.780 --> 01:23.563
<v ->No, it's just me flying solo.</v>

33
01:24.430 --> 01:26.670
<v ->Well you're probably more technical than me.</v>

34
01:26.670 --> 01:28.093
See Boof is here.

35
01:29.400 --> 01:32.610
But he's way over there at the window.

36
01:32.610 --> 01:34.000
Mm-hmm.

37
01:34.000 --> 01:35.220
But he's gotta press all the buttons.

38
01:35.220 --> 01:36.560
You know I don't know how to do this,

39
01:36.560 --> 01:38.390
but I did wanna be here with you all

40
01:38.390 --> 01:40.780
and I hope that everything is going well with you.

41
01:40.780 --> 01:44.170
You know, it just seems like this is not gonna end

42
01:44.170 --> 01:46.160
next weekend for Easter.

43
01:46.160 --> 01:48.910
Those of you who attend services for Passover and Easter

44
01:48.910 --> 01:50.100
and things like that,

45
01:50.100 --> 01:51.730
why don't you get on the virtual?

46
01:51.730 --> 01:54.220
Even my old parents are on the virtual.

47
01:54.220 --> 01:56.340
The virtual church, the virtual temple,

48
01:56.340 --> 02:00.730
the virtual synagogue, the virtual worship services.

49
02:00.730 --> 02:04.030
They work for my parents held up in their apartment.

50
02:04.030 --> 02:05.583
They're not going anywhere.

51
02:06.793 --> 02:07.860
(sighing)

52
02:07.860 --> 02:11.060
Anyway, we've got lots of notes and things like that.

53
02:11.060 --> 02:13.560
Luenell is gonna come on.

54
02:13.560 --> 02:15.740
We got "Ask Wendy" coming up.

55
02:15.740 --> 02:19.060
The "Empire" season finale has been scrapped.

56
02:19.060 --> 02:23.290
Well, I love "Empire" and I root for that show.

57
02:23.290 --> 02:25.163
Excuse me, it's been canceled.

58
02:27.490 --> 02:29.090
Right, Norman?

59
02:29.090 --> 02:29.950
Not scrapped.

60
02:29.950 --> 02:32.780
<v ->Right, they, because of the shut down,</v>

61
02:32.780 --> 02:35.060
they had to cancel the last two episodes

62
02:35.060 --> 02:38.740
so now after six seasons, we got no ending.

63
02:38.740 --> 02:41.910
<v ->Well you are really invested in that show</v>

64
02:41.910 --> 02:44.280
so you're the one who really feels like

65
02:44.280 --> 02:46.220
you want something but, you know,

66
02:46.220 --> 02:49.640
what are they supposed to do, Norman, to satisfy you?

67
02:49.640 --> 02:51.330
Exactly.
<v ->Maybe come back</v>

68
02:51.330 --> 02:53.680
for a movie or something when all this is over.

69
02:55.230 --> 02:56.990
<v ->I venture to say that a lot of people</v>

70
02:56.990 --> 03:01.420
who think that greatness is with them right now,

71
03:01.420 --> 03:04.200
when this is over people might've forgotten,

72
03:04.200 --> 03:06.400
you know, moved on to something else.

73
03:06.400 --> 03:10.163
So the last episode is happening on April 12th.

74
03:11.130 --> 03:13.450
April 12th, oh, 21st.

75
03:13.450 --> 03:14.690
Same difference.
<v ->Yeah.</v>

76
03:14.690 --> 03:16.580
<v ->You're swapping one for a two.</v>

77
03:16.580 --> 03:17.908
<v ->Right.</v>

78
03:17.908 --> 03:19.350
(laughing)

79
03:19.350 --> 03:21.390
<v ->By the way, in case you hear some chirping</v>

80
03:21.390 --> 03:22.900
during our broadcast,

81
03:22.900 --> 03:24.460
just know that I've been dealing with

82
03:24.460 --> 03:29.310
a broken smoke detector for the past one month.

83
03:29.310 --> 03:31.200
And me and ChitChat and Myway

84
03:31.200 --> 03:33.130
are so used to it we're desensitized.

85
03:33.130 --> 03:35.270
Eventually, you will be too.

86
03:35.270 --> 03:38.190
Your house probably has something broken too.

87
03:38.190 --> 03:42.470
So Taraji P. Henson, by the way, back to "Empire,"

88
03:42.470 --> 03:46.690
has postponed her wedding ceremony to her fiance

89
03:46.690 --> 03:49.220
because they wanted to have a nice wedding.

90
03:49.220 --> 03:51.740
His name was, what's his name?

91
03:51.740 --> 03:52.573
Calvin?

92
03:53.580 --> 03:55.210
Oh, Calvin.

93
03:55.210 --> 03:56.370
Mm-hmm.

94
03:56.370 --> 03:57.835
Good luck with your Calvin.

95
03:57.835 --> 04:00.040
(laughing)

96
04:00.040 --> 04:00.943
Just saying.

97
04:02.060 --> 04:04.530
<v ->Right!</v>
<v ->So NeNe is now</v>

98
04:04.530 --> 04:07.770
singing rapping and I'm here for it.

99
04:07.770 --> 04:10.700
NeNe, NeNe is so good.

100
04:10.700 --> 04:13.940
I don't know who that is in the studio, oh, Lady Luck.

101
04:13.940 --> 04:16.830
It's called "Come and Get This, Hunni,"

102
04:16.830 --> 04:20.220
which, to me, the hook is everything.

103
04:20.220 --> 04:21.683
How does the hook go again?

104
04:22.840 --> 04:23.716
<v ->I can't sing it.</v>

105
04:23.716 --> 04:24.766
I can't sing it here.

106
04:26.280 --> 04:27.530
<v ->I don't remember it.</v>

107
04:27.530 --> 04:30.143
All I know is that it's good.

108
04:31.090 --> 04:32.350
And why not do it?

109
04:32.350 --> 04:34.470
I mean, those housewives have to do something

110
04:34.470 --> 04:35.463
to stay relevant.

111
04:36.392 --> 04:38.780
There's gonna be no season finale

112
04:38.780 --> 04:40.840
or no, what do you call that?

113
04:40.840 --> 04:42.270
That reunion.

114
04:42.270 --> 04:44.506
There's not gonna be a reunion.

115
04:44.506 --> 04:47.690
<v ->Well it's gonna be filmed online.</v>

116
04:47.690 --> 04:50.180
<v ->Like I said, there won't be a reunion.</v>

117
04:50.180 --> 04:53.160
Nobody wants to see those girls in "Brandy Bunch" boxes.

118
04:53.160 --> 04:55.140
We like to see them all together.

119
04:55.140 --> 04:58.140
We like to see the full costume from ankle up

120
04:58.140 --> 05:00.660
and I understand that's unrealistic

121
05:00.660 --> 05:02.290
but there's some things that...

122
05:07.144 --> 05:09.426
Norman's there for the fights so he says,

123
05:09.426 --> 05:12.817
"Well, how's one gonna pull the other's hair

124
05:12.817 --> 05:14.480
"if they're all at home."

125
05:14.480 --> 05:16.180
And I say also, we won't be getting

126
05:16.180 --> 05:17.720
the absolute truths from everybody

127
05:17.720 --> 05:19.330
'cause you know how you get real strong

128
05:19.330 --> 05:22.483
when you're sitting in a room by yourself.

129
05:24.158 --> 05:25.540
(laughing)

130
05:25.540 --> 05:26.880
No, but you get real strong

131
05:26.880 --> 05:28.160
when you're sitting in a room by yourself.

132
05:28.160 --> 05:29.960
And maybe your husband's over there,

133
05:30.800 --> 05:32.887
giving you, "Yeah, yeah, get her more.

134
05:32.887 --> 05:34.280
"Get her more, say more."

135
05:34.280 --> 05:35.330
Or maybe your girlfriends,

136
05:35.330 --> 05:37.430
maybe you have a little quarantini party,

137
05:37.430 --> 05:39.043
all the way over there.

138
05:40.560 --> 05:43.193
I just, I'm not here for it.

139
05:44.050 --> 05:44.883
Norman?

140
05:46.920 --> 05:49.270
I have to share something with you.

141
05:49.270 --> 05:50.490
<v ->Okay.</v>

142
05:50.490 --> 05:52.913
<v ->And all of my co-hosts.</v>

143
05:54.550 --> 05:57.720
So on Friday evening, I was in the house

144
05:57.720 --> 05:58.920
minding my own business

145
05:58.920 --> 06:01.270
and the 10 o'clock news was on.

146
06:01.270 --> 06:03.230
From 10 to 11 I watch the news

147
06:03.230 --> 06:05.750
and then 11 o'clock, I change to "Seinfeld."

148
06:05.750 --> 06:06.583
It's a routine.

149
06:07.420 --> 06:08.720
I love it.

150
06:08.720 --> 06:11.927
So my phone rings shortly after 10 o'clock.

151
06:11.927 --> 06:13.257
"Wendy!"

152
06:14.840 --> 06:16.028
It's NeNe.

153
06:16.028 --> 06:17.677
(laughing)

154
06:17.677 --> 06:19.050
"Wendy!"

155
06:19.050 --> 06:20.957
I said, "Hi NeNe, why are you screaming?

156
06:20.957 --> 06:22.397
"Why are we on speakerphone?

157
06:22.397 --> 06:23.797
"Your house is big enough.

158
06:23.797 --> 06:26.170
"We don't have to be on, what are you doing?"

159
06:26.170 --> 06:29.510
So she said, "Wendy, I miss seeing you."

160
06:29.510 --> 06:31.800
So she's like, "What you doing?"

161
06:31.800 --> 06:34.847
I was like, "I'm watching the 10 o'clock news

162
06:34.847 --> 06:37.327
"and then "Seinfeld" and then I'm gonna go to sleep

163
06:37.327 --> 06:38.827
"and probably wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning

164
06:38.827 --> 06:40.270
"and watch more TV."

165
06:40.270 --> 06:42.210
She said, "Girl."

166
06:42.210 --> 06:43.607
I said, "Yes, NeNe?

167
06:43.607 --> 06:45.410
"Why are you talking so loud?"

168
06:45.410 --> 06:47.327
She said, "I'm here with all my people.

169
06:47.327 --> 06:49.517
"Everybody, tell Wendy hi."

170
06:51.380 --> 06:53.370
I hear a bunch of, Norman,

171
06:53.370 --> 06:55.210
I hear a bunch of people in the background,

172
06:55.210 --> 06:57.590
how you doin-ing and hi-ing and stuff like that.

173
06:57.590 --> 07:00.640
NeNe goes, "Let's get on Facetime."

174
07:00.640 --> 07:05.513
Norman, now you know I don't have face or time for Facetime.

175
07:06.460 --> 07:07.330
Period.

176
07:07.330 --> 07:09.930
If I don't do it with my own parents or the show,

177
07:09.930 --> 07:12.720
why would I be doing it for somebody over there?

178
07:12.720 --> 07:14.280
You know, which, I like NeNe

179
07:14.280 --> 07:17.250
but she's still an over there person to me.

180
07:17.250 --> 07:21.570
And I felt, honestly, here's where the ambush comes in.

181
07:21.570 --> 07:24.970
She said, "Wendy," she said, "Look."

182
07:24.970 --> 07:26.640
She was in hair and makeup and wardrobe

183
07:26.640 --> 07:28.940
with all her people, right?

184
07:28.940 --> 07:33.940
She said, "We filming and I want you to be on the speaker."

185
07:34.380 --> 07:37.827
I said, "NeNe, I did that for you one time.

186
07:37.827 --> 07:38.807
"You asked me to.

187
07:38.807 --> 07:40.477
"Remember my appearance, Norman?"

188
07:41.870 --> 07:43.080
One time.

189
07:43.080 --> 07:47.720
And I made it very clear, I am not a housewife.

190
07:47.720 --> 07:51.890
Sorry, my career is a bit different

191
07:51.890 --> 07:53.480
than being a housewife.

192
07:53.480 --> 07:56.120
I don't need that kind of attention and,

193
07:56.120 --> 07:59.610
quite frankly, and then I hung up on her.

194
07:59.610 --> 08:00.503
I hung up.

195
08:01.580 --> 08:03.330
I'm not here for this and I hung up.

196
08:03.330 --> 08:05.540
She never called back and apologized.

197
08:05.540 --> 08:09.080
No, no, no, 'cause here's protocol, right?

198
08:09.080 --> 08:11.130
When you call somebody and you want them

199
08:11.130 --> 08:12.610
to participate in something,

200
08:12.610 --> 08:17.037
you call them off speaker in the other room first.

201
08:17.037 --> 08:19.767
"Wendy, you know, I wanna record with you.

202
08:19.767 --> 08:21.060
"Do you think you could?"

203
08:21.060 --> 08:24.170
And I woulda still said, "No, NeNe, I am not a housewife."

204
08:24.170 --> 08:26.250
Like I know I make this look easy

205
08:26.250 --> 08:28.230
and I know I have my ratchet ways

206
08:28.230 --> 08:31.870
but the fact is is that I worked 35 years of my life

207
08:31.870 --> 08:34.940
to sit here for 11 seasons at this...

208
08:36.760 --> 08:39.610
All right, look, look.

209
08:39.610 --> 08:42.420
It's a full motion picture behind the scenes, okay?

210
08:42.420 --> 08:46.650
I'm not slumming by being some add on

211
08:46.650 --> 08:49.000
out of a suitcase for some housewives.

212
08:49.000 --> 08:51.883
And yeah, for me, that is slumming.

213
08:52.800 --> 08:53.633
Norman?

214
08:55.560 --> 08:57.830
I mean, for where I am.

215
08:57.830 --> 09:01.350
Norman, you see the day to day operation of our show.

216
09:01.350 --> 09:02.614
<v ->Right.</v>

217
09:02.614 --> 09:03.623
It's a whole thing.

218
09:05.420 --> 09:07.260
<v ->So anyway, I hung up on her</v>

219
09:07.260 --> 09:09.550
and she never called me ahead of time to ask me

220
09:09.550 --> 09:10.550
and I woulda said no.

221
09:10.550 --> 09:13.960
She never called after or even text to apologize

222
09:13.960 --> 09:15.510
and I still haven't heard from her

223
09:15.510 --> 09:18.590
and now here we are on Monday, that was Friday.

224
09:18.590 --> 09:20.083
So you know what?

225
09:21.150 --> 09:24.363
I would love to know what Wendy watchers this about this,

226
09:25.520 --> 09:26.880
'cause as far as I'm concerned,

227
09:26.880 --> 09:28.570
I don't wanna do anything.

228
09:28.570 --> 09:29.980
If she's seeing it right now,

229
09:29.980 --> 09:33.190
you better not use any of that footage, Bravo.

230
09:33.190 --> 09:35.070
So Chuck D, right?

231
09:35.070 --> 09:37.453
Well the April Fools joke is on you.

232
09:38.990 --> 09:41.840
Chuck D says that kicking Flava Flav outta the group

233
09:41.840 --> 09:43.220
was an April Fools joke.

234
09:43.220 --> 09:45.810
He went on a radio show and talked about it

235
09:45.810 --> 09:47.333
on actual April 1st.

236
09:48.610 --> 09:49.443
You know what, Chuck?

237
09:49.443 --> 09:50.800
You played yourself.

238
09:50.800 --> 09:52.690
I don't believe for a moment 'cause you're not funny.

239
09:52.690 --> 09:54.240
You don't have a funny bone.

240
09:54.240 --> 09:56.390
Why are you even involved with April Fools?

241
09:57.522 --> 09:59.680
And why weren't you in the house that day?

242
09:59.680 --> 10:02.353
Why are you in a studio walking around?

243
10:03.560 --> 10:06.670
So Chuck is 59 and Flava Flav is 60

244
10:06.670 --> 10:09.250
and Flav didn't say anything for a moment

245
10:09.250 --> 10:13.000
but Flav has finally come out and said it wasn't a joke.

246
10:13.000 --> 10:14.840
I was fired from the group

247
10:14.840 --> 10:17.290
and I don't have anything more to say about this.

248
10:17.290 --> 10:19.930
This is Chuck trying to make this seem

249
10:19.930 --> 10:23.570
like this is Flava Flav's fault and that this was a joke.

250
10:23.570 --> 10:25.220
I believe you, Flav.

251
10:25.220 --> 10:27.200
You know, it's a sad day, Chuck,

252
10:27.200 --> 10:30.480
when Flava Flav is coming off in such a critical time

253
10:30.480 --> 10:33.250
smarter than you, okay?

254
10:33.250 --> 10:36.070
Number one and number two, I guess it was difficult

255
10:36.070 --> 10:40.350
to just book Chuck D around the world, right?

256
10:40.350 --> 10:43.570
First of all, nobody's booking but when they start booking,

257
10:43.570 --> 10:46.760
you're not doing those songs without Flav up there.

258
10:46.760 --> 10:50.350
Flav, on the other hand, I do see, Norman.

259
10:50.350 --> 10:53.170
I do see where Flav, once the corona's off,

260
10:53.170 --> 10:55.320
and he can actually travel, I can see

261
10:55.320 --> 10:58.560
where Flav could make some money off just being Flava Flav.

262
10:58.560 --> 10:59.822
<v ->Absolutely.</v>

263
10:59.822 --> 11:02.330
<v ->'Cause everybody likes him.</v>

264
11:02.330 --> 11:05.890
<v ->It's fun and it's nostalgic and it's great.</v>

265
11:05.890 --> 11:06.723
<v ->Yeah.</v>

266
11:06.723 --> 11:07.556
<v ->I would see him.</v>

267
11:07.556 --> 11:09.263
Now Chuck D, on the other hand,

268
11:10.270 --> 11:11.913
I gotta put my thinking cap on.

269
11:12.760 --> 11:13.780
<v ->Right now everybody,</v>

270
11:13.780 --> 11:18.140
I have to bring in my funny friend, Luenell.

271
11:18.140 --> 11:22.520
Luenell, everyone has banned her daughter from her home

272
11:22.520 --> 11:24.850
because the daughter was very disrespectful

273
11:24.850 --> 11:26.880
of the coronavirus.

274
11:26.880 --> 11:31.653
Now, when last I talked to Luenell, she was in the bathtub.

275
11:33.220 --> 11:34.828
The visual of it all.

276
11:34.828 --> 11:35.890
(laughing)

277
11:35.890 --> 11:38.950
And so she's scrub-a-dub-dub

278
11:38.950 --> 11:43.260
and somewhere relaxing in her apartment

279
11:43.260 --> 11:44.910
that she shares with her husband.

280
11:45.810 --> 11:47.170
Luenell, are you there?

281
11:47.170 --> 11:49.052
How you doin?

282
11:49.052 --> 11:51.090
<v ->How you doin, girl?</v>

283
11:51.090 --> 11:51.923
(laughing)

284
11:51.923 --> 11:53.730
<v ->Okay, the nails live on.</v>

285
11:53.730 --> 11:54.563
Let me see.

286
11:54.563 --> 11:56.090
Nail-Cam.

287
11:56.090 --> 11:57.203
Fabulous.

288
11:59.390 --> 12:02.600
<v ->You know the virus is taking over the world</v>

289
12:02.600 --> 12:04.250
but if I get taken out,

290
12:04.250 --> 12:06.690
I'm gonna be taken out with my nails, girl.

291
12:06.690 --> 12:07.740
<v ->How's your husband?</v>

292
12:08.690 --> 12:11.973
<v ->My husband is doing well, thank goodness.</v>

293
12:13.580 --> 12:15.330
As I told you, he suffers from COPD

294
12:16.320 --> 12:20.660
which is one of the reasons that I had to

295
12:21.760 --> 12:25.530
take the steps that I had to do by quarantining,

296
12:25.530 --> 12:29.150
not kicking out my daughter, from my home,

297
12:29.150 --> 12:34.140
because of the fact that she has certain,

298
12:34.140 --> 12:36.540
little small crews she been around

299
12:36.540 --> 12:39.030
but I don't know where they've been.

300
12:39.030 --> 12:42.760
So it wasn't, it was a heartbreaking decision

301
12:42.760 --> 12:44.000
but it's what I had to do

302
12:44.000 --> 12:46.520
for the health of myself and my husband.

303
12:46.520 --> 12:48.860
If she still want her mama, go home.

304
12:48.860 --> 12:49.693
She got a home.

305
12:50.540 --> 12:53.110
<v ->So where is she staying now?</v>

306
12:53.110 --> 12:55.360
<v ->Well now she's visiting her dad</v>

307
12:55.360 --> 13:00.060
and she's quarantining with her father up in the Bay area.

308
13:00.060 --> 13:01.340
But she has her own place.

309
13:01.340 --> 13:03.310
She's been having her own place.

310
13:03.310 --> 13:05.860
<v ->But why wasn't she quarantining to begin with, Luenell?</v>

311
13:05.860 --> 13:08.150
This just happened the other day.

312
13:08.150 --> 13:11.980
<v ->Yes, she did not, unfortunately,</v>

313
13:11.980 --> 13:15.690
she did not make the decision to do the quarantine.

314
13:15.690 --> 13:19.340
I did and that is sometimes the problem.

315
13:19.340 --> 13:22.560
The kids don't make the decision to stay away

316
13:22.560 --> 13:24.960
from Grandma and Grandpa.

317
13:24.960 --> 13:28.130
We have to make it for them as sort of a tough love.

318
13:28.130 --> 13:30.750
Now, if the roles were reversed

319
13:30.750 --> 13:34.650
and if the kids were getting ill from things

320
13:34.650 --> 13:36.300
that older people had,

321
13:36.300 --> 13:39.760
we would do everything in our power to make sure

322
13:39.760 --> 13:42.110
that we did not infect the kids.

323
13:42.110 --> 13:46.240
They unfortunately have not, some of them,

324
13:46.240 --> 13:49.570
are not making that decision in our best benefit.

325
13:49.570 --> 13:53.320
So I took matters into my own hands and I locked the door.

326
13:53.320 --> 13:55.520
<v ->Well you know I called you when I saw that.</v>

327
13:55.520 --> 13:58.384
I texted you and said, "I applaud that."

328
13:58.384 --> 14:02.070
Now this thing about no more hugging your fans.

329
14:02.070 --> 14:03.860
Tell us about it.

330
14:03.860 --> 14:08.120
<v ->Well, I normally do meet and greets</v>

331
14:08.120 --> 14:11.210
and people catch me on the street and in restaurants

332
14:11.210 --> 14:13.660
and I guess I got that auntie vibe

333
14:13.660 --> 14:17.020
that everybody wants to hug me and stuff like that,

334
14:17.020 --> 14:21.570
but if you come to my shows, there'll be no more of that.

335
14:21.570 --> 14:22.998
There's no more meet and greet.

336
14:22.998 --> 14:26.100
We might greet but we can't meet.

337
14:26.100 --> 14:29.080
If you have a picture of me hugging on you,

338
14:29.080 --> 14:32.920
kissing on you, licking on you, I've been guilty of that,

339
14:32.920 --> 14:36.840
that is a collector's item 'cause don't touch me no more.

340
14:36.840 --> 14:40.390
I already had allergies from cheap perfume

341
14:40.390 --> 14:42.433
and cheap makeup where my eyes swell up.

342
14:43.490 --> 14:46.940
I'm allergic to trap girls, you can say that.

343
14:46.940 --> 14:51.940
But EpiPens are $600 for two.

344
14:52.120 --> 14:52.953
So-
<v ->Well-</v>

345
14:52.953 --> 14:54.450
<v ->I can't, you know, we just can't.</v>

346
14:54.450 --> 14:55.820
So it's over for me.

347
14:55.820 --> 14:57.150
No more kissing.

348
14:57.150 --> 14:58.680
No more hugging, that's it.

349
14:58.680 --> 15:00.210
<v ->What do you think three years from now?</v>

350
15:00.210 --> 15:03.490
Do you think you'll be back to it, 'cause I won't.

351
15:03.490 --> 15:04.700
<v ->No!</v>

352
15:04.700 --> 15:05.871
<v Wendy>Yeah.</v>

353
15:05.871 --> 15:08.290
<v ->I'll be glad to not be, you know,</v>

354
15:08.290 --> 15:12.060
or how sanitary is it to be kissed and hugged on

355
15:12.060 --> 15:14.900
by 50 people during a show.

356
15:14.900 --> 15:18.690
That's not even sanitary in a non-virus world

357
15:18.690 --> 15:20.470
and you have always practiced that.

358
15:20.470 --> 15:22.750
You give 'em the elbow or whatever like that.

359
15:22.750 --> 15:25.490
But I'm not doing it anymore.

360
15:25.490 --> 15:26.450
I can't.

361
15:26.450 --> 15:28.453
<v ->So tell us about your YouTube show.</v>

362
15:29.990 --> 15:31.360
<v ->The word is out.</v>

363
15:31.360 --> 15:32.403
I thank you.

364
15:33.270 --> 15:37.220
Since I've been quarantined, I wanted to find a way

365
15:37.220 --> 15:40.570
to stay connected to my fans, you know?

366
15:40.570 --> 15:43.860
Not just my old content but something new and fresh.

367
15:43.860 --> 15:45.750
This is my set.

368
15:45.750 --> 15:47.870
I broadcast from home.

369
15:47.870 --> 15:50.440
My show is called "Hey Luenell,"

370
15:50.440 --> 15:53.210
and it's on YouTube and you can,

371
15:53.210 --> 15:55.570
if you follow me on Instagram @Luenell,

372
15:55.570 --> 15:59.720
L-U-E-N-E-L-L, they can just click the link in the bio.

373
15:59.720 --> 16:03.100
It takes you straight there and you can subscribe.

374
16:03.100 --> 16:07.830
I go live every Wednesday at 3 pm California time.

375
16:07.830 --> 16:10.131
We have lots of things we've been talking about.

376
16:10.131 --> 16:14.250
This will be ebbing so far and I have a hot topic

377
16:14.250 --> 16:17.070
to talk about myself this coming Wednesday

378
16:17.070 --> 16:19.270
so just follow me and subscribe

379
16:19.270 --> 16:22.650
and I'd be very glad to say hi to everybody.

380
16:22.650 --> 16:23.483
<v ->Bye, Luenell!</v>

381
16:23.483 --> 16:24.340
Thank you so much.

382
16:24.340 --> 16:25.726
Stay safe.

383
16:25.726 --> 16:27.190
<v ->Okay, bye bye.</v>

384
16:27.190 --> 16:28.660
<v ->Okay, it's time...</v>

385
16:30.380 --> 16:32.620
And you know what's weird, Norman?

386
16:32.620 --> 16:36.080
People had said to me before, "Watch NeNe,"

387
16:36.080 --> 16:37.767
and I was like, "No!

388
16:37.767 --> 16:39.107
"Why?

389
16:39.107 --> 16:40.730
"We're just two girls hanging out,"

390
16:40.730 --> 16:43.350
but I'll tell you, I do feel ambushed.

391
16:43.350 --> 16:45.190
Anyway, it is time for "Ask Wendy."

392
16:45.190 --> 16:46.047
Let's go.

393
16:46.047 --> 16:48.630
(upbeat music)

394
16:53.370 --> 16:55.310
Oh, how you doin?

395
16:55.310 --> 16:57.150
<v ->How you doin, Wendy?</v>

396
16:57.150 --> 16:58.170
<v ->Fine, thank you.</v>

397
16:58.170 --> 17:00.490
What's your name and where are you from?

398
17:00.490 --> 17:01.910
<v ->Hi Wendy, I'm Alexandra.</v>

399
17:01.910 --> 17:03.433
I'm from North City.

400
17:04.340 --> 17:05.750
<v ->And what do you do?</v>

401
17:05.750 --> 17:07.870
<v ->I'm actually a radio personality as well</v>

402
17:07.870 --> 17:10.230
so you're one of my biggest inspirations.

403
17:10.230 --> 17:12.700
Hopefully, I'm gonna emulate you.

404
17:12.700 --> 17:14.730
<v ->Your breasts are probably bigger inspirations</v>

405
17:14.730 --> 17:16.550
to a lot of people watching.

406
17:16.550 --> 17:18.590
They're gigantic.
<v ->I got the Wendy,</v>

407
17:18.590 --> 17:20.420
the Wendy boobs too.

408
17:20.420 --> 17:22.467
<v ->Oh, I don't think so.</v>

409
17:22.467 --> 17:23.340
(laughing)

410
17:23.340 --> 17:25.720
I feel like a first grader next to you.

411
17:25.720 --> 17:27.690
So anyway, how can I help you?

412
17:27.690 --> 17:29.780
<v ->Well Wendy, I really need help, girl.</v>

413
17:29.780 --> 17:32.450
I just got engaged and I got engaged

414
17:32.450 --> 17:35.290
to a very manly man, very macho man,

415
17:35.290 --> 17:37.450
but when it comes to this wedding planning,

416
17:37.450 --> 17:40.450
he has become a total Groomzilla.

417
17:40.450 --> 17:42.370
I thought I was gonna be the Bridezilla.

418
17:42.370 --> 17:43.830
He's planning our whole wedding.

419
17:43.830 --> 17:45.580
He knows where we're gonna get married,

420
17:45.580 --> 17:47.530
what the centerpieces are looking like.

421
17:47.530 --> 17:49.410
He's already vetoed dresses, yes,

422
17:49.410 --> 17:51.230
so all this won't be showing.

423
17:51.230 --> 17:53.070
Wendy, what can I do to let him know

424
17:53.070 --> 17:55.243
that this is my day, not his.

425
17:56.110 --> 17:58.980
<v ->Have you talked to your mom about this yet?</v>

426
17:58.980 --> 18:02.404
<v ->Well no, I haven't been able to talk to her about it</v>

427
18:02.404 --> 18:03.237
too much.
<v ->It's okay.</v>

428
18:03.237 --> 18:04.337
<v ->She super-</v>
<v ->How do you,</v>

429
18:04.337 --> 18:06.820
how do you get along with his mother?

430
18:06.820 --> 18:08.570
<v ->I get along with his mother well.</v>

431
18:10.410 --> 18:11.570
<v ->I think this is a conversation</v>

432
18:11.570 --> 18:13.300
that you need to have with your fiance.

433
18:13.300 --> 18:15.730
By the way, congratulations on your engagement.

434
18:15.730 --> 18:16.563
<v ->Thank you!</v>

435
18:16.563 --> 18:19.150
<v ->This is probably not the time to be planning a wedding</v>

436
18:19.150 --> 18:22.293
'cause the way he's going at it and you don't like it,

437
18:23.348 --> 18:26.300
you might have to give back that engagement ring.

438
18:26.300 --> 18:30.330
'Cause the divorce rate is up during this quarantining.

439
18:30.330 --> 18:35.330
So you wanna avoid arguing about something like the wedding.

440
18:35.510 --> 18:37.680
The biggest thing is that you all have each other's loves.

441
18:37.680 --> 18:39.410
Why don't you get a virtual minister

442
18:39.410 --> 18:41.610
and just get married at you all's apartment?

443
18:43.160 --> 18:44.700
And then, well-

444
18:44.700 --> 18:46.171
<v ->Will you marry us?</v>

445
18:46.171 --> 18:47.004
(laughing)

446
18:47.004 --> 18:48.910
<v ->No thank you, I don't wanna be involved.</v>

447
18:51.000 --> 18:52.550
But here's the deal.

448
18:52.550 --> 18:54.530
Get a virtual minister, get married,

449
18:54.530 --> 18:57.000
wait until the winter or next spring

450
18:57.000 --> 18:59.760
and then have a party for the friends and family

451
18:59.760 --> 19:03.190
and that party, you and your husband will both be a part.

452
19:03.190 --> 19:05.410
Quite frankly, I don't like men involved

453
19:05.410 --> 19:09.120
in grown women's stuff and I always think of a wedding,

454
19:09.120 --> 19:10.890
sorry for being traditional,

455
19:10.890 --> 19:15.483
as more about what she wants than what he wants.

456
19:16.350 --> 19:18.570
You know, as a matter of fact,

457
19:18.570 --> 19:19.990
I'll go so far as to say,

458
19:19.990 --> 19:23.323
he can choose the entire honeymoon situation.

459
19:24.240 --> 19:25.640
You got it.

460
19:25.640 --> 19:28.810
Pay for it, choose it, get us there,

461
19:28.810 --> 19:31.010
but the wedding, my dress, the venue?

462
19:31.010 --> 19:31.940
That's mine.

463
19:31.940 --> 19:33.077
I wish you well.

464
19:33.077 --> 19:34.680
<v ->Thank you so much, Wendy!</v>

465
19:34.680 --> 19:36.530
Stay healthy, stay safe.

466
19:36.530 --> 19:37.363
<v ->Thank you!</v>

467
19:37.363 --> 19:39.300
We have one more "Ask Wendy."

468
19:39.300 --> 19:40.133
how you doin?

469
19:41.040 --> 19:42.130
<v ->How you doin, Wendy?</v>

470
19:42.130 --> 19:42.980
My name is Linda.

471
19:43.970 --> 19:44.850
<v ->Linda?</v>

472
19:44.850 --> 19:45.683
<v ->Yes.</v>

473
19:45.683 --> 19:46.860
<v ->Okay, where you from?</v>

474
19:46.860 --> 19:50.760
<v ->I'm from Washington D.C., and basically what's going on is</v>

475
19:50.760 --> 19:52.640
my boyfriend of three years,

476
19:52.640 --> 19:55.920
he has crazy ex-girlfriends who have been harassing me

477
19:55.920 --> 19:57.900
and trying to ruin my life.

478
19:57.900 --> 19:59.690
They went as far as making multiple

479
19:59.690 --> 20:02.490
fake profile accounts on Instagram,

480
20:02.490 --> 20:05.700
they reached out to my clients talking negatively about me.

481
20:05.700 --> 20:07.700
I have spoken to my boyfriend about it

482
20:07.700 --> 20:10.330
and he's such a nice guy so him talking to them

483
20:10.330 --> 20:12.530
didn't really do anything and it still continued.

484
20:12.530 --> 20:14.560
So my question is, what should I do?

485
20:14.560 --> 20:17.713
Should I check these women by myself or?

486
20:18.640 --> 20:19.900
I don't know.

487
20:19.900 --> 20:21.610
<v ->Well, what do you do for a living?</v>

488
20:21.610 --> 20:22.960
<v ->I'm a makeup artist.</v>

489
20:22.960 --> 20:27.913
<v ->Okay, so then having a public is paramount.</v>

490
20:30.020 --> 20:32.870
First of all, I don't think that your ex

491
20:32.870 --> 20:35.480
is going hard enough in his conversation with them.

492
20:35.480 --> 20:37.270
You already said that he's a nice guy.

493
20:37.270 --> 20:39.000
Maybe he's being too nice with them.

494
20:39.000 --> 20:43.260
Although, if he's done it once and they haven't stopped,

495
20:43.260 --> 20:45.210
'cause you know girls can be mean.

496
20:45.210 --> 20:47.330
<v ->Very mean.</v>
<v ->Any they can be jealous.</v>

497
20:47.330 --> 20:49.400
You're the one who landed the prize

498
20:50.270 --> 20:52.770
and they're all ganging up on you.

499
20:52.770 --> 20:55.290
Well stop reading the comments, you know?

500
20:55.290 --> 20:57.640
<v ->I do, I do block them but it gets hard</v>

501
20:57.640 --> 21:00.420
because I do see it either way

502
21:00.420 --> 21:03.600
but I do end up blocking it but it just keeps continuing.

503
21:03.600 --> 21:04.810
<v ->There's nothing you can do</v>

504
21:04.810 --> 21:08.270
and I do not suggest that you lower yourself

505
21:08.270 --> 21:10.560
to their level and step to them.

506
21:10.560 --> 21:11.560
Don't do it.

507
21:11.560 --> 21:12.400
<v ->Okay.</v>

508
21:12.400 --> 21:13.233
<v ->Don't do it.</v>

509
21:13.233 --> 21:14.640
Just, you know, you're gonna have to deal

510
21:14.640 --> 21:16.900
with the situations that's been created for you.

511
21:16.900 --> 21:19.860
You're with this guy, they're jealous of that

512
21:19.860 --> 21:22.370
and jealous of, maybe you have a successful

513
21:23.310 --> 21:27.040
makeup situation going on there and they're jealous

514
21:27.040 --> 21:28.310
and you can't stop that.

515
21:28.310 --> 21:30.040
All you can do is rise.

516
21:30.040 --> 21:31.300
<v ->Just live with it.</v>

517
21:31.300 --> 21:32.570
<v ->Yup.</v>

518
21:32.570 --> 21:33.821
Well thank you!

519
21:33.821 --> 21:34.930
<v ->Thank you so much, Wendy.</v>

520
21:34.930 --> 21:35.930
Stay safe!

521
21:35.930 --> 21:36.980
Have a good one.

522
21:36.980 --> 21:38.400
<v ->Thank you, you as well.</v>

523
21:38.400 --> 21:39.530
<v ->All right, bye.</v>

524
21:39.530 --> 21:40.857
<v ->Bye.</v>

525
21:40.857 --> 21:41.890
(laughing)

526
21:41.890 --> 21:43.670
I love these "Wendy at Homes."

527
21:43.670 --> 21:45.640
I could get used to this,

528
21:45.640 --> 21:47.500
until we can go back to the real show.

529
21:47.500 --> 21:49.400
In the meantime everybody, up next,

530
21:49.400 --> 21:54.400
an encore presentation of our show featuring Ja Rule.

531
21:54.570 --> 21:56.139
Love you, be well.

532
21:56.139 --> 21:58.722
(upbeat music)

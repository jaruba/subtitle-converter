From the myths of the north,

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,135
Germanic tribes headed south,

3
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,846
Reaching as far as
the borders of the Roman Empire.

4
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:15,641
Barbarians,
the Romans called them.

[somber music]

00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,019
[narrator] But in 375 AD,

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,230
the most feared of all warriors,

8
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,941
descended upon Europe,
murdering and pillaging.

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,569
The Huns
triggered a great migration.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,196
Hundreds of thousands

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,281
of Goths, Vandals and Franks,

12
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,575
went in search
of a new homeland.

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,995
They sapped Rome.

14
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,501
Some tribes disappeared,
almost without trace.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,629
Others left behind
valuable treasures.

16
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,048
The Germanic Barbarians

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,050
were to become
the founders of Europe.

[opening theme music]

19

[narrator] 375 AD, the Huns
were devastating Europe.

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,773
Hoards of Germanic peoples

21
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,108
fled through the Roman Empire

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,026

00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,756
great tribal migrations.

27
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,134
The mortal remains
of many Germans

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,927
found their last resting place

29
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,097
in the anthropologists
storeroom, in Budapest.

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,145
The skull of a Visigoth.

31
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,190
What could he have
experienced and suffered?

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,774
What might he have looked like?

33
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,364
For anthropologists,
a skull is not just a skull.

34
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,244
A recent scientific process

35
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,580
makes it possible
for Anges Gustar

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,124
to restore
the faces of dead people.

37
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,836
Ancient deeds
have handed down the names

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,755
and deeds of the great kings,

39
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,216
while the fate
of ordinary people

40
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,842
remains largely unknown.

41
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,095
Yet we can find out
something about them today.

42
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,725
Anthropologists, archaeologists
and historians are all involved.

00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,108
into his past.

[pulsating]

47
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,667
[narrator] He was one of
one hundred thousand Visigoths.

48
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,294
A people
who made their mark in history

49
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,880
and completely changed
the ancient world.

50
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,928
To the Romans,
he was sometimes an enemy,

51
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,179
sometimes a friend.

52
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,266
However, they always
called him a Barbarian.

53
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,185
Although,
like them, he was a Christian.

54
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,189
As a warrior,

55
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,941
he took part
in the Visigoths journey

56
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,651
across the whole of Europe.

57
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,153
He moved
through Greece and the Balkans.

58
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,282
He besieged and conquered Rome

59
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,616
with King Alaric.

60
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,910
He traveled over
seven thousand kilometers

61
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,161
with the Visigoths.

62
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,002
Only
in the south of France, in 418,

63
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,879
did he find a permanent home.

64
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,464
After wandering
for over forty years.

[casual music]

dangers and hardship,
wars and battles.

68
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,729
The historian, Jordanis,

69
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,023
reported
on the fate of the Visigoths.

70
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,317
from the knowledge of the old,

71
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,485
from songs and stories.

our Visigoth escaped the Huns

74
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
with his family, just in time.

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,125
Until then,
they had lived peacefully

76
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,293
near the Roman Empire.

77
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,546
It was the year, 376 AD.

78
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,050
Men, women and children
gathered with their belongings

79
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,053
at the Danube, on the border
of the Roman Empire.

80
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,097
It took weeks,
to ferry everyone across

81
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,517
to safety
on hastily built rafts.

82
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,859
There was always fear!

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,946
They knew
the greedy looting Huns

84
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,072
were on their way.

to escape from them.

[narrator] Terrible stories
were told of their appearance.

00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:28,996
They were said to be ugly,

[narrator] The only
way out for the Visigoths

98
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,714
was to flee across the Danube.

99
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,260
The Visigoths asked
the Emperor Wallins for refuge

100
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,345
and vowed to submit to his rule,

101
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,183
to live according to his laws,
and to become Christians.

102
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,896
The emperor has said
to have taken them in

103
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,190
prone misericordia out of mercy.

104
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,359
In fact,
the Roman Emperor was too weak

105
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,653
to defend itself
on the Huns on its own,

106
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,531
it desperately needed
the Goth warriors.

[haunting music]

108
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,624
[narrator] The Huns had come
from deep in the Asian steppes.

109
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,462
In 375, they subjugated
the Allen's and the Ostrogoths,

110
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,089
and drove
the Visigoths ahead of them.

111
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,219
Their army was created
to make the world tremble!

112
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,679
They turn up
where they are least expected

113
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,140
and attack the people
with robbery and cunning.

[narrator] For the people
of the ancient world,

116
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,898
The Huns were the
most feared of all the warriors.

117
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,025
Never before
had people experienced

118
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,693
such brutal fighting.

119
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,112
They are extremely fast.

120
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,864
They sit on their agile horses,

121
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,074
as if they are one with them.

122
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,825
In the fury of battle,

123
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,744
they aim with calm hands.

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,373
Their arrows
bring certain death.

or cultivates a field.

128
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,845
They know no occupation
other than hunting,

129
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,429
and they
roam about like robbers.

00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,815
[narrator] The Huns were
mounted nomadic warriors.

134
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,984
They stole
everything they needed.

135
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,362
Grain, livestock,
gold, even people.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,663
While many smaller groups

137
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,999
wondered about
looting indiscriminately,

138
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,542
the Huns were far more

139
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,003
than a collection
of wild undisciplined hordes.

140
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,672
They subordinated
themselves completely

141
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,798
to their leaders,

142
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,925
and were capable
of far reaching

One was fatal.

149

The three-winged tip
of a Hun arrow.

150
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,618
It found its mark
in a Germanic spine.

151
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,292
The Hungarian archaeologist,
Peter Tomka,

152
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,961
excavated
a significant Hun treasure.

153
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,922
The pan and harmer find.

154
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,592
Insignificant pieces
of gold leaf were part of it.

155
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,011
He was able
to use them to reconstruct

156
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,597
one of the
fearsome composite bows.

157
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,855
The Huns magic weapon.

158
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,067
Feared for its range
and penetrating power.

[whooshing noise]

the bridles of the Huns horses

162
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,199
from other fragments of gold.

163
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,743
The Huns
lead them with snaffle bits,

164
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,787
and were the first
to put proper saddles

on their horses,
to give the riders support.

00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,795
The Huns were agile riders,

167
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,590
and feared archers
at the same time.

168
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,550
At full gallop,
they were still able

169
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,927
to shoot up to
thirty arrows per minute.

170
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,264
[dramatic music]

171
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,226
[narrator]
Another significant find

172
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,979
is this heavy
sacrificial cauldron

173
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,773
from the Huns Empire,
north of the Danube.

174
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,194
Under their king, Atelier,

175
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,905
they became
an ancient super-power.

176
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,990
He aimed to rule the world.

177
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,785
His legendary residence

178
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,955
is presumed to be between
the Danube and the Trays.

179
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,166
According
to ancient descriptions,

180
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,710
his palace,
with its Roman bathhouse

181
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,922
and surrounded by palace aids,
could have looked like this.

182
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,718
The power of the mounted nomads

183
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,345
became a threat to Rome.

184
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,768
The Danube in Budapest,

185
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
was once
a border of the Roman Empire.

186
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,857
After the Huns had driven
the Goths north of the Danube,

187
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,527
this part of Hungary
became their empire.

188
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,202
The Huns are
horribly deformed monsters.

189
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,038
Instead of a face,
they have a repulsive lump

190
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,499
with pinholes, rather than eyes.

191
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,004
That is how
their enemies described them,

192
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,507
giving no more
than a distorted image.

193
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,467
But what did Atelier's warriors

194
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,679
who aroused
so much fear, really look like?

195
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,057
The anthropologist, Agnes Kustar

196
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,184
knows how to reconstruct faces.

197
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,940
Now we are
able to see a Hun's face

198
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,485
being restored
1500 years after his death.

199
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,865
It's not an imaginary face

200
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,366
emerging under her hands,

201
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,785
she's using
a scientific process.

202
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,581
After weeks of work,

203
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,166
the skull
turns into a real face.

204
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,670
That of a Hun, with the
characteristic small eyes,

205
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,256
flat nose and broad cheekbones.

206
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,782
[narrator] The horse riding
people of Mongolia today,

207
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,951
have the same facial features.

208
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,038
It's assumed that
the Huns once came from there.

209
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,833
What frightened both the
Germans and the Romans?

210
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,793
Was there strange appearance

211
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,087
coupled with their
merciless fighting style?

212
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,007
The Ostrogoths
were among the first people

213
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,259
to be attacked
by the Huns in 375.

214
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,429
[dramatic music]

215
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,975
[narrator] Their legendary
king, Ermanaric, was feared

216
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,519
because of his
valiant war deeds.

217
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,188
He ruled over a huge empire,

218
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,482
but the Huns
had already attacked

219
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,359
and subjugated
the neighboring tribes.

220
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,780
Ermanaric knew
that his Ostrogoth

221
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,615
would also lose their freedom.

222
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,493
As Amiyanos Markalenos puts it,

223
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,079
he himself neither
wanted to experience that,

224
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,456
nor to be responsible for it.

225
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,584
In the face
of the terrible dangers

226
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,921
which threatened, and fearing
to make crucial decisions,

227
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,923
he put an end to his life.

228
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:20,926
[galloping]

229
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,138
[narrator] He died,
because he could not bare

230
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,473
the veracity of the Huns.

231
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,310
But his death gave them
power over his people.

232
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,858
The Visigoths, however,

233
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,110
refused to submit to the Huns.

234
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,113
They would rather
conquer a kingdom

235
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,447
out of their own efforts,

236
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,242
than to be subject
to others out of sluggishness.

237
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,747
In the year 376,

238
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,083
the Visigoths
crossed the Danube.

239
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,377
It was
the beginning of the greatest

240
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,087
of the tribal migrations.

241
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,137
A hundred thousand
men, women and children,

242
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,472
including ten thousand warriors,

243
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,433
were fleeing from the Huns.

244
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,146
[dramatic music]

245
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,318
[narrator] The exiles were
accepted into the Roman Empire.

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,321
Legend has it,
that the emperor joyfully

247
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,782
consented to taking them in
as people seeking help.

248
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,160
They did have to submit to Rome,

249
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,038
but were allowed
to keep all their weapons.

250
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,416
For the empire
depended on the Visigoths army.

251
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,715
The Visigoths wanted
to become part of the empire,

252
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,426
and to participate
in the wealth and achievements

253
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,886
of Roman civilization.

254
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,139
For this,
they were willing to defend

255
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,557
the empire's borders.

256
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,479
The Visigoths
were the first German's

257
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,440
to settle
in the empire as allies of Rome,

258
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,442
as a state, within a state.

259
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,195
They were settled
south of the Danube.

260
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,366
A valiant outpost
of the empire, against the Huns.

261
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,582
What the
fleeing tribe left behind,

262
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,459
on the far side of the Danube,

263
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:19,711
is preserved in Bucharest today.

264
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,007
The capital of Romania,
was once the land of the Goths.

265
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,137
The national museum
houses one of the largest

266
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,850
and most significant findings
from the age of migration,

267
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,018
the treasure of Petrosa.

268
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,146
A royal treasure with more than

269
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,858
forty kilograms
of gold and precious stones,

270
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,777
which the Goths buried
after fear of the Huns.

271
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,615
As it has already been
stolen from the museum once,

272
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,743
it is now housed
in a high security wing.

273
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,455
It was found by peasants

274
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,499
in the
Eastern Carpathians in 1837.

275
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,879
Illegal trade, blackmail,
robbery and even deaths

276
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,089
are all part
of the treasure's history.

277
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,925
And of course,
people say today that

278
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,720
there is a curse
on the barbarians gold!

279
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,603
It is the pride of the
Romanian National Museum.

280
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,898
This is why,
as a special privilege,

281
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,942
the archaeologist, Radu Harhoiu,

282
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,069
is showing us the full splendor

283
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,237
of this unique find.

284
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,614
[narrator] The Barbarians,
Mothers of God,

285
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,115
made of pure gold.

286
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,328
The priceless treasures were
status symbols for the living.

287
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,081
For the dead kings of the Goths,

288
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,749
they were an appropriate gift

289
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,000
for the other world.

290
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,550
Red [indistinct]
stud saddle mountings buckles,

291
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,969
and magnificent fibula
or clasps.

292
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,429
The world famous Eagle Fibula,

293
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,223
from the Petrosa Treasure,

294
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,518
the Goths made the
royal bird of prey their symbol.

295
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,149
For archaeologists,
the eagle motif

296
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,901
is often the only trace

297
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,070
of the Goths
wanderings throughout Europe.

298
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,282
[mysterious music]

299
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,455
[narrator] In 395 however,

300
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,416
they had
to leave their settlement,

301
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,750
south of the Danube.

302
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,089
On their forty year wanderings,

303
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,758
they traveled through Greece,
the whole of the Balkans,

304
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,510
and on towards Italy.

305
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:22,269
Robbed of their homeland
by Huns and Romans,

306
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,730
and having
escaped enemy weapons,

307
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,816
they sought
a new abode in foreign parts.

308
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,449
Almost
one hundred thousand Visigoths

309
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,660
had been traveling
in the Roman Empire since 376.

310
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:41,163
They had made Alaric their king.

311
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,708
He would go down in history
as the conqueror of Rome.

312
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,132
He led the refugees,
more than ten different peoples

313
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:55,385
who had herded together,
including Asiatic tribes.

314
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,724
Not descent,
but courage and valor

315
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,060
decided who would be of goth.

316
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,484
Human restlessness
drove them on.

317
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,111
Through impossible
unknown terrain.

318
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,072
They were looking for a land,

319
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,573
that could
feed such a multitude.

320
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,537
Those words
applied to the Visigoths

321
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,789
more than any other
ancient people.

322
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,209
They would be
on the move for forty years.

323
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,336
A true philodendron,

324
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,089
migrants, wandering endlessly.

325
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,843
As a child,
he had fled across the Danube.

326
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,387
As a man, he became a warrior,

327
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,847
like all the Goths.

328
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,977
The nomadic life
became second nature

329
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,103
to the Visigoths.

330
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,106
And new generations
grew up, knowing nothing

331
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,109
but the tribulations
of life on the move.

332
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,779
[dramatic music]

333
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,826
[narrator] They tried
again and again to win asylum

334
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,828
in the Roman Empire
by force of arms.

335
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,497
For decades, it was in vain.

336
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,255
At the same time
as the Visigoths,

337
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,591
other Germanic peoples
were also fleeing.

338
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,178
The Huns,
had also driven out the Vandals,

339
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,763
who crossed the Rhine in 406,

340
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,183
and pillaged their way to Spain.

341
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,643
When they
had finished looting the south,

342
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,354
they began
to implement a daring plan.

343
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,900
They made their way
from Gibraltar to Carthage.

344
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,697
Tarifa,
on the strait of Gibraltar.

345
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,950
From here, Genseric ,
the King of the Vandals,

346
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,580
dared to cross to Africa
with his people in 429 AD.

347
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,126
Over the Mediterranean

348
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,254
came an invasion
as huge as it was dangerous.

349
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,091
They landed
near Tangier, in Morocco.

350
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,093
Africa was enticing!

351
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,804
A country full
of legendary treasures

352
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,057
and blessed
with abundant resources.

353
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,146
The Vandals
are like the wrath of God.

354
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,650
They set fire to cities
and steal all of the provisions.

355
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,362
The starving people
are forced to eat human flesh.

356
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,697
Mothers even eat their children.

357
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,662
So rouge their adversary,
Isidore of Seville.

358
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,622
He was a Roman Catholic.

359
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,500
The Vandals however,
were Arian Christians.

360
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,544
Wanton heretics in his eyes.

361
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,129
That's why Isidore
made the Vandals

362
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,257
the villains
of the great migration.

363
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,675
[dramatic music]

364
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:40,968
[neighing]

365
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,055
[narrator] So today,
vandalism has come to mean

366
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,432
blind destructive rage.

367
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,226
This is wrong.

368
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,478
Like all the other
Germanic peoples,

369
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,981
the Vandals
were only fighting for survival.

370
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,573
Genseric had them all counted

371
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:04,449
for their trip
across the Mediterranean.

372
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,994
Eighty thousand people took part

373
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,912
in the great Vandal journey,

374
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,207
including other tribes,
such as Alans and Suebi.

375
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:17,129
From Tangier, they still had

376
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,464
a seven year
long march ahead of them.

377
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,051
On the way, they took
what was there for the taking.

378
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,220
And conquered Roman towns.

379
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,435
The Roman provincial town
of Duguay, in Tunisia,

380
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,146
one of many through
which the Vandals passed.

381
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,317
Not a trace of vandalism,

382
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,486
the town fell victim
to the normal ravages of time.

383
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,866
In the shadow of the capital,

384
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,993
they would have
learned the local language.

385
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,623
Opposite,
the hot springs of Duguay,

386
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,083
with steam baths
and massage rooms.

387
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,714
When they had captured Africa,

388
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,716
they took hot baths every day,

389
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,801
and lived in magnificent villas.

390
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,306
For the Vandals,
Africa was Arcadia,

391
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:10,933
paradise on earth.

392
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,854
Underneath the town,

393
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,981
are the achievements
of Roman civilization.

394
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,067
Running water, sewage,

395
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,402
and floor heating
for cold nights.

396
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,950
The Christian Vandals put an end

397
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,536
to the Romans
bloody gladiatorial combats.

398
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,082
But they would have
gone to the theater

399
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,334
to both comedies and tragedies.

400
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:39,711
Besides,
why would the Vandals

401
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,797
have destroyed
what they wanted to occupy,

402
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,299
in the style
of the Romans who they admired?

403
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,432
The Bardo Museum
in Tunisia is replete

404
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,351
with evidence
of ancient culture.

405
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,729
Nowhere,
are so many and such artistic

406
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,566
mosaic floors
preserved as in Tunisia.

407
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,612
The archaeologist,
Ieshia Benabed,

408
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,240
is fascinated
by the idea that here,

409
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,618
Vandals walked
on many of the mosaics,

410
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,620
chatted to the Romans in Latin,

411
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:17,708
listened to Greek music and
celebrated bacchanalian feasts.

412
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,336
Hundreds on mosaic floors
from the Vandal period

413
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,131
tell stories
of the life of the Barbarians

414
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,632
under the African sun.

415
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:33,432
Dancers and music,
everything that delights the eye

416
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,225
and the ear, were customary.

417
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,395
They were no less devoted
to the joys of the wine cup,

418
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,355
than to those of love.

[narrator] The blue-eyed
blond people from the north,

421
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,657
had once been desired as slaves.

422
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,036
Now, they became
the masters of the country.

423
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,496
They did not just dispose,

424
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,082
but also
purchased villas and land

425
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,209
from their owners.

426
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,419
It is known
from surviving documents,

427
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,296
that they respected Roman law.

twenty artisans
are working under Ieshia Benabed

431
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,982
restoring
mosaics for the museum.

432
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,985
Year after year,
new ones are excavated.

433
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,654
They can hardly
keep up with the work.

00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,330
Ieshia Benabed is training
young women

00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,665
in the traditional craft.

439
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,501
They are using original mosaics

440
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,503
from the
Vandal period as models.

441

During excavations, Iesia
found out the local experts

442
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,760
laid the mosaics
in the Vandals villas

443
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,929
with motifs of Roman myths,

444

and scenes from everyday life

of a richly laid table.

They ate the best that
the sea and the land produced.

Thus writes the
early historian, Procopius.

451
00:27:01,163 --> 00:27:02,581
They adapted very quickly

to conditions
on the Mediterranean,

in the style of the Romans
they so admired.

455
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:21,642
The African provinces were named
the Granaries of Rome.

456
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,520
For centuries,
the fertile land provided

457
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:28,649
the people of Rome with grain,
dried dates, wine and oil.

458
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,534
In Africa,
the Vandals sought and found

459
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,785
the promised land.

460
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,788
Their Garden of Eden
as they knew it from the Bible.

461
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,333
However,
their goal was Carthage.

from Gibraltar, took six years.

466
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,809
They had reached
the second and third generations

00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,477
in their search for a new home.

468
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,313
Not many of those
who had first fled from the Huns

469
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,400
in their homeland in the
cold rainy north, were left.

[narrator]
The Vandals had left Spain,

472
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,284
and crossed the Mediterranean
to take possession

473
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,911
of the Roman provinces
in Africa for themselves.

474
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,539
The emperor,
too weak to fight them,

475
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,040
made peace with the Vandals

476
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:29,376
and generously handed over
a part of Africa

477
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,086
to their king, Genseric.

478
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,050
Genseric was forty years old.

479
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,887
A general who was
as brilliant as he was brutal.

480
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,848
A clever
strategist and diplomat.

481
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,518
Their king,
Genseric, was a deep thinker.

482
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,314
Silent, furious in anger,
acquisitive, far-sighted,

483
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,940
and extremely cunning.

484
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,030
That is how
the Gothic historian,

485
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,698
Jordanis, described him.

486
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,659
Genseric led
his people for fifty years,

487
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,288
and made the Vandals
a power, feared by Rome.

488
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,415
[majestic music]

489
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,170
[narrator] They met no
significant resistance in Africa

490
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,173
as there was no longer
a Roman army to block their way.

491
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,434
So, Genseric led his Vandals

492
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,895
without
major losses, to Carthage.

493
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,401
This is how archaeologists
imagined how Carthage looked.

494
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,738
It was one of the largest
port cities of antiquity.

495
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,576
To protect it
against the Vandals,

496
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:46,870
a wall
was built around the metropolis,

497
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:48,455
but to no avail.

498
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,376
Genseric took the city
by surprise, during peacetime.

499
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,786
[narrator] However,
according to Ieshia Benabed,

500
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:30,914
Carthage did not suffer
under the Vandals rule.

501
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,084
In fact, the ancient
metropolis in the Bay of Tunis

502
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,753
became
dangerous competition for Rome.

503
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,215
[casual music]

504
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,472
[narrator] The Carthage
basin has been here

505
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:49,141
for thousands of years.

506
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,768
The legendary prize
of the Roman war

507
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,770
and merchant fleet was here.

508
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,356
It fell
into the hands of the Vandals.

509
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,570
They were not
originally seafarers,

510
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,655
but took
to the sea very quickly.

511
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,744
From here,
the Vandals soon controlled

512
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,621
distant parts
of the Mediterranean

513
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:11,788
with their fleet.

514
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,000
They conquered
the Balearic Islands,

515
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,252
Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily.

516
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,924
They sailed
up the Tiber, sacked Rome,

517
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,343
and expanded
their kingdom in Africa.

518
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,560
Archaeologists have excavated
the villa area of Carthage,

519
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,646
and partially reconstructed it.

520
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,899
This is where
the richest of the rich lived.

521
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:41,068
The Vandal kings joined them,

522
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:43,820
in order to live the life
of luxury like the Romans.

523
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,401
[narrator] To this day,
Ieshia Benabed

524
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:25,529
and her colleagues, have not
found any traces of destruction

525
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,365
by the Vandals anywhere
in the whole of Tunisia.

526
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:30,450
Once they settle down, she says,

527
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:35,080
they had only one interest,
to assimilate, to integrate

528
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:37,875
into society,
and live like civilized Romans.

529
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,918
[casual music]

530
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,968
[narrator] So the Vandals rule

531
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,262
is not a blot
on Tunisia's history.

532
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,347
On the contrary, it was a period

533
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,391
of independence from Rome.

534
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:56,643
Thus,
like many countries in Europe,

535
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,980
Tunisia also has
a Germanic history.

536
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,693
[haunting music continues]

537
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,703
[narrator] Archaeologists
found important evidence

538
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,664
of the Vandals role
deep in the south of Tunisia

539
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:21,668
in [indistinct] which is
Arabic for the arcades.

540
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,218
A baptismal font
from the Vandal period

541
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,928
lies buried under rubble.

542
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,056
The Vandals
are regarded as suppressors

543
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,807
of the Roman Catholics here.

544
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:39,102
The archaeologist,
Fahti Bejaoui, has excavated

545
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:42,314
the Basilica
of the Vandal king, Thrasamund.

546
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,858
He was more tolerant
in religious matters

547
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,110
than his opponents
would have it, he says.

548
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,651
[narrator] The Vandals
were Arian Christians,

549
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,404
but the local people
were Roman Catholic Christians.

550
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,573
The Vandals later gave up

551
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,075
persecuting the Catholics
in order to win them over.

552
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,709
The Basilica in [indistinct]
is evidence of this.

553
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,920
Here, both Arians
and Catholics went to church,

554
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,756
were married,
and had their children baptized.

555
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,055
The Basilica was built in 521,

556
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:58,599
in the 26th year

557
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,226
of the rule
of the Vandal King, Thrasamund.

558
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:13,197
Anno, Bicesimovi,
Domni, Treasamundi.

559
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,742
It is the only known
inscription of the Vandals.

560
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:23,415
After the Vandals failed
to keep their promises to Rome,

561
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,752
the emperor sent
General Belisarius with troops

562
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:30,589
in 533. He defeated
the Vandals convincingly.

563
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,925
After
one hundred and four years,

564
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,594
their empire
in Africa ended forever.

565
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,057
Over one hundred years before,

566
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,768
the Visigoths
had journeyed through Greece

567
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,020
and the Balkans,
fleeing from the Huns.

568
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:49,441
In the year 408,
they appeared in Italy.

00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:51,401
[screeching]

570
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,530
[narrator] In 40 of wandering,

571
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,198
about two generations,

572
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,368
they had traveled more than
three thousand kilometers.

573
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,662
Alaric, was their king.

574
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,291
At the foot of the Italian Alps,

575
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,794
they were hoping
for more than asylum.

576
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,755
For the emperor
needed Germans as legionaries.

577
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:16,218
Sometimes fighting,
sometimes negotiating.

578
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:20,138
They had moved from the
Byzantine to the Roman world.

579
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:24,142
Refuges between the fronts
of the divided empire.

580
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,858
All the Visigoths, eighty to
one hundred thousand of them,

581
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:33,026
were on their way to Rome.

582
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:36,405
Including twenty thousand
experienced warriors!

583
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,948
A sizable army.

[dramatic music]

585
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,417
[narrator] The army had lost
many battles against the Romans,

586
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,043
but not the war.

587
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,090
Emperor Humorous was inclined
to underestimate them.

588
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,675
He lived to regret it.

589
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:09,313
Ubbi, Benni, Ebbi, Partia.

590
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,524
Where I live well,
that is my country.

591
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,319
And where
could the Visigoths live better,

592
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:18,488
than in the land
of their dreams, Italy.

593
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,825
It was 409 AD.

594
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:25,329
King Alaric sent an emissary
to Emperor Humorous,

595
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:28,790
to ask whether his people
could stay peacefully in Italy.

596
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,877
And offering him
the services of the Goths.

597
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,675
Rome, the eternal city.

598
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,178
The Visigoths
admired the achievements

599
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:42,804
of remnant civilization,

600
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,848
the prosperity,
and the legal system.

601
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,184
They did not
want to destroy all that.

602
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:50,896
The Germans wanted
participation and integration.

603
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,232
They wanted
to become like the Romans.

604
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:58,070
Alaric told the emperor
that the Visigoths were willing

605
00:37:58,195 --> 00:37:59,947
to defend
the frontiers of the empire,

606
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,658
and wanted to live
in such harmony with the Romans,

607
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,785
that they could be
taken for one people.

608
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:07,579
But if the emperor
were to refuse the request,

609
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,998
the stronger of the two
would drive away the weaker,

610
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,417
and the victor
would rule in peace.

With their military strength
greater than ever,

614
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,015
the Visigoths were confident.

615
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,726
Their army
was extremely well equipped.

616
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:32,563
Many of them had served
as officers and generals

617
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:33,981
in the Roman army.

willing to serve Rome for gold,

he refused

to stop the Barbarians.

644
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,068
The walls
are still standing today.

645
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,324
For the Visigoths,
the city proved impregnable.

646
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,535
As they were approaching,

647
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,913
Emperor Humorous had the
gates closed to Alaric's hordes.

648
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:17,334
Apparently, 10,000 Romans
were ready to defend the city.

The thicker the grass,
the easier it is to mow,

the eternal city.

It was the third time,
this time they were serious.

655
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,689
They cut off the water supply,

656
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,983
and blocked
the grain shipments to Rome.

657
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,360
Rome was thirsty and starving.

658
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:47,531
Epidemic spread.
Sixty thousand Germanic slaves

659
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:49,491
were waiting
for their liberators.

660
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,077
They had plenty of accounts
to settle with the Romans.

661
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:53,954
Turmoil reigned.

662
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:56,582
To prevent things getting worse,

663
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:00,210
a noble lady
apparently had a gate opened

664

The Visigoths
pillaged, killed and raped.

669
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,230
At Alaric's behest,
the Visigoths sacked Rome.

670
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,399
However,
they did not set fire to it,

671
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,401
as wild peoples usually do.

672
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,487
And did not allow any

Roma capta.

On the
twenty-fourth of August, 410,

675
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,414
Rome was captured.

676
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,875
After eight hundred years,

677
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,460
the most
powerful city in the world,

678

was once again

[serious flute music]

[narrator] While his warriors
were marauding in Rome,

682
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,808
Alaric proved himself
to be a Christian.

683
00:41:57,392 --> 00:41:59,144
The Pantheon, the former temple

684
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:02,105
of all the Gods, was now
a Roman Catholic church.

685
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,108
For a thousand years,
it was the largest in the world.

686
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:14,201
Alaric placed all the priests
under his personal protection.

687
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,411
No one
was allowed to touch them.

And he forbid

Although they were Arians,

00:42:24,002 --> 00:42:25,838
they respected
the Roman Catholic Church,

and the bishop of Rome.

693

Many Romans preferred
the Christian Barbarians

00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,853
to their fellow citizens,
who still offered

that Jesus
was one substance with God,

699

[narrator] Alaric never
wanted to roll over the empire.

704
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,558
All he wanted
was a place for his people

705
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,018
in the Roman Empire.

706
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,645
But,
the emperor refused him that.

707
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:25,981
An error
with fateful consequences!

708
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,110
The city of Rome
has been conquered,

that previously

lamented Humorous,
a father of the Church.

711
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:40,996
Rome had lost
much of its power.

712
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,832
The Roman Empire
had long been an invalid,

713
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:47,711
barely able to survive,
without the Germanic peoples.

714
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,381
So, the Goths merely toppled,
what was already falling.

715
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:55,886
Only after eight more
years of wandering and war,

716
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,180
were they able to settle
in the Roman provinces

717
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,933
in the south of France, in 418.

718
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:04,728
They finally became
what they always wanted to be,

719
00:44:04,895 --> 00:44:07,481
legionaries,
in the service of Rome.

720
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,029
As hospices,
or guest workers for a period,

721
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,281
they received latifundia,

722
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:18,700
or estates from the Roman state.

723
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,828
But like all guest workers,
they would remain.

724
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,541
The Visigoth immigrants
must have lived in harmony

725
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:26,875
with the local people.

726
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,794

The Visigoth kingdom
in the south of France.

However, they did not

themselves in it.

History has
demonized the king of the Huns,

and made him
into an anti-Christ.

It is true,
that Attila could only increase

his kingdom at the expense
of the western Roman Empire.

The battlefield was a plain,
with a gradual incline.

General Aetius and his Romans
formed the left flank,

while King Theodoric

when they saw the piles

How great,
must the hatred have been

00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,371
to make them all resort
to arms against one another?

Not only Huns and Romans
lay among the dead

counted more than descent.

803
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,777
The relationship
between their tribes,

804
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:23,904
did not prevent
the Germans from fighting

805
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:25,572
one another to the death.

806
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:27,658
[haunting music continues]

807
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,915
[narrator] And then
the Visigoths found their brave

808
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:37,876
and noble king,
Theodoric, among the corpses,

809
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,087
pierced
by the spear of an Ostrogoth

810
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,632
from a related tribe,
who had followed Aetius flags.

811
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,428
It was forced fratricide,

812
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,098
Jordanis wrote
in his saga of the Goths.

813
00:48:53,725 --> 00:48:54,935
In the battle however,

814
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,979
it was
the courageous Visigoth army

815
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,856
that attacked
Aetius and the Huns,

816
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:00,274
and forced them to flee.

817
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:07,281
Was it the Barbarians,
the Visigoths of all people,

818
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,033
who saved
the Roman Empire from the Huns?

819
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,244
That's one way of looking at it!

820
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:14,788
After they had terrorized
Europe

821
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:18,333
for eight years,
the myth of the invincible Huns

822
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:19,459
was shattered!

823
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:26,967
[dramatic music]

824
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,310
[narrator]
They had finally been defeated

825
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:40,105
by the alliance of the Romans,
Visigoths and Franks.

826
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:43,650
Their rule in Europe
had come to an end!

827
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:48,864
Their king,
Aetius, died in 453 AD.

828
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:52,201
The Huns moved back
to the steps of Asia.

829
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:55,245
Just as they
appeared from nowhere,

830
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,624
they vanished again,
into nothing.

831
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:05,255
In 463 AD,
everything was open again.

832
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:08,634
Would Rome
regain its power and strength?

833
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:12,888
Would the Germanic Barbarians
destroy the Roman Empire

834
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,848
and the ancient civilization?

835
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:19,311
Or would they
become the heirs of the empire?

836
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,527

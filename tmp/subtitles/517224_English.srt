and another Oracle Key is really there then we have to go.

00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,955
why there are two Oracle Keys in Nuuma.

165
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,091
- Well... It's said the Spirit Oracle

166
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,193
bestowed upon the Queen of Nuuma

167
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,897
a Key for safe keeping many years ago.

168
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,767
And then there came the second Key...

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,337
It is said the Hero Quake brought it with him

170
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,706
when he came to Nuuma.

171
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,308
- That is so cool!

172
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,277
It proves the Hero Quake existed.

173
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,314
- Well... that is what I believe.

174
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,418
- Good! Then this is really meant to be.

175
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,421
I've decided. - What?

176
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,823
- I will make the journey to Nuuma.

177
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,826
And with the power of my own Oracle Key,

178
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,363
I'll defeat those evil Invectids once and for all.

179
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:02,368
- There'll be no stopping Hunter... I'm sure of that.

180
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,238
- Magma... have you...

181
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:11,143
ever wondered why the Spirit Oracle left four Keys in this world?

182
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,980
What does she wants us to do with them?

183
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,017
- I'm not sure... but I do know

184
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,686
that they have incredible power.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,389
And that the Invectids will go to any lengths

186
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,225
to get their hands on them. That's for sure.

187
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:30,730
- Seems like a good reason to go to battle.

188
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,699
- I agree with you.

189
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,105
- Why am I so worried?

190
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,109
Hunter is right. As Spider Riders, it is our duty

191
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,012
to protect everyone who needs our help.

Will you rescue the people of Nuuma?

- I don't know, Sparkle, it's hard to say.

- But why?

196
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:02,762
- Oh, Sparkle... I dream of a place where no one has to fight.

197

Where everyone lives in peace and harmony.

198
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:13,305
But of course... that's just a lovely dream. Ha!

- Out there in the distance...

203
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,785
It's coming toward us.

This, without a doubt, is Grasshop's greatest plan ever!

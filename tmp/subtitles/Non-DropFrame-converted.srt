00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:41,601

9
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,898
- Thank you, Pearl, for that fine rendition.

10
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,235
Now, a few words from the sheriff.

11
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,276
- A quick community note for you.

12
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,445
The Browns are having an auction this Sunday

13
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,546
with the proceeds going to help--

14
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,182
- That's us, that's our auction.

15
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,417
- They got chocolate cream pies at this thing.

16
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,120
- Jack, take human bites.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,988
- Ready?

18
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,556
- Always, Cap'n.

19
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,857
- I look stupid.

20
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,092
- You're beautiful.

21
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,361
- I'd rather be sailing.

22
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:43,963
- Now, if you would let me talk to you a little bit

23
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,698
about firework safety.

24
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,768
Now, everyone be careful with them fireworks, okay?

25
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,870
And now our Independent State Youth Speech,

26
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,072
Molly-- (microphone feedback)

27
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,808
Molly Brown.

28
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,053
- Our ancestors fought many battles.

29
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,521
From the beginning of our country,

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,557
they have believed in faith.

31
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,059
Since my dad's always telling me that I'm stubborn,

32
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,861
I mean, independent, (audience laughter)

33
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,830
I guess our forefathers and mothers were independent, too.

34
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,300
They had faith in something they really couldn't see.

35
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,068
(striking match drowns out words)

36
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,770
to the crackle of a gun fire.

37
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,673
(firecrackers)

38
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,547
That's it, you're dead Cory.

39
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,749
Jack, take it back way.

40
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,722
Let's go, Jillian!

41
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,157
- Settle down, everybody, just settle down.

42
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,959
Just another prankster.

43
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,827
Pearl, can we get another one

44
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,896
of your beautiful renditions?

45
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,398
- [Voiceover] This is you, Dr. Turner?

46
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,601
- Yes, ma'am, a long time ago, when I was --

47
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,303
- And that story about the lost treasure.

48
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,705
Do you still believe it?

49
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,840
- Uh, as I wa saying--

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,610
- You never found it, did you, Dr. Turner?

51
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,046
- No, ma'am, just a couple of coins, an old letter,

52
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,948
and an awful lot of mud.

53
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,418
- Well, there's no sense beating a dead horse, Dr. Turner.

54
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,988
(laughter)

55
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,824
- He has not aged well, at all.

56
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,960
- Not aged well, huh?

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,630
Well, I still got the old Turner charm.

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,634
Plus the IQ of the combined population of this town.

59
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,569
Just one more piece of the puzzle,

60
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,071
and that treasure will be mine.

61
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,919
- You kids better be more careful, geez!

62
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,322
This is a new shirt.

63
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,890
- [Voiceover] I'd rather Jimmy (engine drowns out words)

64
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,625
house on the hill.

65
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,729
- Molly, could you run this right over to your grandfather?

66
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,097
It's a get-well card.

67
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,999
- But...

68
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,837
Yes, Mrs. Stephenson.

69
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:10,043
- Poor girl, being raised without a mother.

70
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,345
Practically lives on that river.

71
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,415
And she talks to herself.

72
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,150
A lot.

73
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,087
- She reminds me a lot of her grandfather.

74
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,822
Sometimes too much.

75
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,090
So, how are you doing, Paul?

76
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,693
You found anything, yet?

77
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,595
- No, not a lot of work for historians right now.

78
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,566
- There never is, I should know.

79
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,668
I wish I could get you on here.

80
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,438
- Thanks, when they cut back at the college,

81
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,605
I didn't really think I'd--

82
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,342
- Yes, yes, things are tight all over.

83
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,244
Listen, Paul, I've inventoried all of the--

84
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,679
(car honking)

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,448
Things you gave us from Sara's research,

86
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,983
but I can't seem to find the old diary.

87
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,586
- I suppose it could be stored some place else.

88
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,822
After she died, I didn't really have the heart to--

89
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,959
- Well, without the diary, we might not be as interested.

90
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,895
Would your father-in-law know something?

91
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,431
- I don't think so, he's not doing so well.

92
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,301
- Well, how about I stop by when you have more time?

93
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,669
- Okay, sure.

94
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,006
(strong, whimsical music)

95
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,482
- [Voiceover] Uh oh, kid, bad hair day.

96
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,151
- Alex, I'm Nurse Rancette.

97
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,121
Welcome to White River Foster Care.

98
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,424
Hands out of your pockets and look at me, please.

99
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,526
You've been placed in three foster homes

100
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,062
and run away from all three.

101
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,565
Each time you stole from the good people who took you in.

102
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,335
That adds up to ...

103
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,303
- Trouble.

104
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,707
- And now you've been sent here.

105
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,544
If you steal, or run from me,

106
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:55,414
the next stop is Juvenile Detention Center,

107
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,684
and that would be bad now, wouldn't it?

108
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,786
Simonton?

109
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,921
- Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,589
- Correct.

111
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,760
Rule number one, you do not leave the property grounds

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,062
unless otherwise authorized.

113
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,064
Do you understand?

114
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:13,966
What?

115
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,834
- Yeah.

116
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,036
- Yes what?

117
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,171
- Yes ma'am.

118
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,072
- Yes ma'am what?

119
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,910
- Yes ma'am, yes ma'am, three bags full.

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,278
(laughter)

121
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,446
- Enough, follow me.

122
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,067
- Don't you got some kid stuff to do?

123
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,270
- Yeah, honey, he's probably going to sleep all afternoon.

124
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,442
- Now look the main sail.

125
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,078
Taking the helm.

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,817
Pull in the slack, the spanker.

127
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,585
- Spank her?

128
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,420
I hardly know her.

129
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,955
- He's a master sailor.

130
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,524
You should give him more respect.

131
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,160
- R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,429
Spank it to me, baby.

133
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,130
(laughter)

134
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,701
- Molly. (coughing)

135
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,772
Get me some water, will you, babe?

136
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:31,210
Oh, thank you, dear, oh.

137
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,449
How's the river, huh?

138
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,851
- Water's up a little with all the rain.

139
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,686
- How's my house?

140
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,356
- Dad and I have been going through old boxes of stuff.

141
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,558
We have to auction off, Cappy,

142
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,526
because we don't have enough money to--

143
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:51,163
- Money, money, money.

144
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,536
You do believe in the treasure, don't you, Molly?

145
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,071
Your mother knew.

146
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,275
She knew it was there.

147
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,144
- She never found it, nobody has.

148
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,549
- Maybe it's time now for you to finish what she started.

149
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,851
It's your journey now.

150
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,287
- But Cappy.

151
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:20,226
- The river is, at night,

152
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,362
it mirrors clear sight.

153
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,233
Your story told,

154
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,002
of the soldier's gold.

155
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,371
- [Molly] Cappy.

156
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,074
- Time for your nap, Cappy.

157
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:42,014
- Faith, truth,

158
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,417
and courage.

159
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:56,595
(nostalgic piano music)

160
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:22,188
(whimsical music)

161
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,425
- [Jack] Hey, Molly, I mean Cap'n.

162
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,029
- [Molly] Is our science officer ready?

163
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,131
- In position, up the river.

164
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,033
- Or home watching Star Trek.

165
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,935
- [Molly] Helmets?

166
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,869
- Jack.

167
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,771
Helmets, check.

168
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,140
- Check.

169
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,541
- Thanks.

170
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:48,948
(whistling)

171
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,753
(banjo music)

172
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,155
- All head full.

173
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:05,131
- Next time, I'll look out and Jillian's pedaling.

174
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,969
(banjo music)

175
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,813
- Keep sharp lookout!

176
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,528
- Can't keep this up.

177
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,832
I need fuel.

178
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,673
Wow, Mom was wrong, these are good for you.

179
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,310
I'm Superman now.

180
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,746
- Jack, check the rope!

181
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:58,484
- Uh, Captain, the rope's off, again.

182
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,785
Over.

183
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,754
- We're slowing down!

184
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:06,425
(suspenseful music)

185
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,129
- I could use a drink.

186
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,034
Thanks.

187
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,536
- I can't believe it, every time!

188
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,805
Go fill up some water balloons.

189
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,040
- Fire!

190
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,945
(yelling muffled)

191
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,613
- [Voiceover] You need to cool off!

192
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,551
- I'm out of there in less than one hour.

193
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:37,556
Ha, beating my own record, with travel money.

194
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,928
- My ammo's gone!

195
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,432
- Engine room, we're running in for lunch.

196
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,000
- Twinkies?

197
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,378
- I'm hit, I'm hit!

198
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,980
- Yes!

199
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,783
- Matty coming.

200
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,621
- My ammo's gone!

201
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,894
- Jillian, raise the white flag!

202
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,129
- Looks like they're out of ammo!

203
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,843
- Hurry, before they--

204
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,012
Never mind.

205
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,950
(triumphant music)

206
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,991
- [Voiceover] Jack, do something!

207
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,996
- [Voiceover] Hal, I thought you had a plan.

208
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,765
They're killing us.

209
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,534
- Roger, Blue Leader, I copy.

210
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,408
- This battle stops, my cover's blown.

211
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,780
- Hey, the white flag's up!

212
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,049
Don't you know the kid's code of the river?

213
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,152
(laughter)

214
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,354
- Uh oh.

215
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,189
- [Voiceover] We like to sing, we like to dance,

216
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,858
we see Molly's underpants.

217
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:24,363
(laughter)

218
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,101
- [Voiceover] Hal, if you're gonna do something,

219
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,104
now would be a good time.

220
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,174
- Roger, Blue Leader, dropping on your 20, over.

221
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,977
- On my what? Over?

222
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,646
- If I were you, I'd duck.

223
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,849
(engines buzzing)

224
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,451
- What are you doing here, kid?

225
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,053
- Uh, I'm just trying to hide?

226
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,924
(engines buzzing)

227
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,026
- What's that?

228
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,861
- I would hide.

229
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,465
(engines buzzing) - Run!

230
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,134
- Couldn't have said it better, myself.

231
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:06,672
(engines buzzing)

232
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,781
- Here comes somebody's mom.

233
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,616
Boy, does she look mad!

234
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:21,053
- That's no mother, that's Evil's evil twin.

235
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,755
You gotta hide me.

236
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,457
Kids' code of the river?

237
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,159
- There's no kids' code of the river for you.

238
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,062
You threw a water balloon at me when the white flag was up.

239
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,168
- Well, if they catch me, I'm downriver to Juvenile Hall.

240
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,605
In there?

241
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,374
- If you don't wanna get caught.

242
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,210
- But I can't swim.

243
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,950
- Better hurry.

244
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,487
- I hope there's no snakes.

245
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,692
This water's cold.

246
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,562
Oh my gosh.

247
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,370
- Simonton!

248
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,607
All right, children, where is he?

249
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,576
- Where is who?

250
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,278
- Our recent arrival.

251
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,613
I know he's here, I heard voices.

252
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,283
- I think you heard our voices, ma'am.

253
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,453
- It's not safe out here for a young boy.

254
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,155
You can't trust that boy, you know.

255
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,525
He steals from everyone.

256
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,061
- He's a thief?

257
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,576
(yelling)

258
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,727
- You're only making this harder on yourself.

259
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,095
- Hey, don't hurt him.

260
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,630
- It's for his own good, dear.

261
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,433
- Everything checks out.

262
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,668
(dialing)

263
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,639
Except, where's Unit Seven?

264
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,673
- Come on.

265
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,308
- Not cold.

266
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,577
Not cold?

267
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,112
That water was freezing!

268
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:31,483
(engines buzzing)

269
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,586
- Ah, kids, come on!

270
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,789
- [Voiceover] Bad hair day!

271
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,760
- Bad remote helicopter.

272
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,897
Bad, bad, bad.

273
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,904
- Oh the humanity!

274
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,374
And to think they pick on poor, helpless Twinkies.

275
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,010
Come to Papa.

276
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,580
- You're too old to be cute anymore.

277
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,184
10 years old, no parents, and a juvie to boot.

278
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,287
There are no more foster homes for you, mister.

279
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,490
You're an orphan with no prospects of ever having a family.

280
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,259
Get that into that thick little head of yours.

281
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,262
And if you ever run away again, I'll chain you to your bed.

282
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,897
Forever.

283
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,137
(mellow banjo music)

284
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:40,953
- [Molly] Hey, Dad.

285
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,155
Dr. Turner.

286
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,223
- Hello, Molly.

287
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,591
- What happened to you?

288
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,426
- You should see the other guys.

289
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,628
- We were just talking about your grandpa.

290
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,330
- The museum would like to purchase some things

291
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,365
before the auction.

292
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,666
- What things?

293
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,603
- Oh, any of your grandfather's Civil War relics.

294
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,006
Any of Sara's, your mother's research regarding the--

295
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,574
- The lost treasure?

296
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,443
- Did you ever see her diary, honey?

297
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,745
- We're willing to pay a nice price.

298
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,114
- Even if I did know where it was, it's not for sale.

299
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,816
- Molly, that's not polite.

300
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,519
- Dad, that belongs to us.

301
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,022
- Paul, maybe you and I should talk about this later.

302
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,092
- Okay, thanks, Louis.

303
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,066
- What was that all about?

304
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,135
- We can take the journey, Grandpa said.

305
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,537
- Where?

306
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:36,542
(inspirational music)

307
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,343
Your grandpa's not doing well.

308
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,379
He says some crazy things.

309
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,647
- I believe him.

310
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,081
We can take the boat, Dad.

311
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,018
- You're not going after any treasure, it's dangerous.

312
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,920
And besides, it's all just a story.

313
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,755
It's not true.

314
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,990
- Mom thought it was.

315
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,826
(melancholy music)

316
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,397
- Listen, young lady, no treasure hunt.

317
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,167
- If we found that treasure, we'd solve all our problems.

318
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,469
- Money doesn't solve problems.

319
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,972
Besides, I've already worked things out with the museum.

320
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,840
Dr. Turner will pay for those Civil War relics

321
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,208
of your grandfather's.

322
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,510
- Turner's a snake.

323
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,878
- You might as well know that snake

324
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,480
thinks he's found a buyer for this house.

325
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,549
- Dad, this is Grandpa's house.

326
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,485
- Even then, we still can't cover his medical costs.

327
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,821
He's been sick a long time.

328
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,457
- I won't leave the river.

329
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,259
- Molly!

330
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:36,468
(brushing teeth) (toilet flushing)

331
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,474
(loud radio blasting)

332
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,877
- Simonton, turn down the music!

333
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,414
(phone ringing)

334
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,152
- Where is she?

335
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,787
She's gotta be there.

336
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,123
Faulty wiring at the foster home.

337
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,791
Try again.

338
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:10,068
(phone ringing)

339
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,072
- White River Foster Care, Beatrice Rancette speaking.

340
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,409
Oh, hello Director.

341
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,444
Oh, yes sir.

342
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,346
- I'll be there in two days.

343
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,915
And I'm bringing Mr. Farr of White River paper.

344
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,218
- Oh, of course, yes sir.

345
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,421
Um, why the head of a paper company, sir?

346
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,724
- [Director] You just be sure everything is in good order.

347
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,960
No trouble, especially with the children.

348
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,062
- Oh, of course sir, absolutely.

349
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,064
Everything will be spit-spot.

350
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,735
(rock music)

351
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,344
Simonton!

352
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,279
- Yes, Nurse Rancid?

353
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,415
- Rancette, idiot.

354
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,789
More than I need to know, Simonton.

355
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,925
- Yes, Rancette.

356
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,662
- Look, the director is com--

357
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,999
Would you cover up, please?

358
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,504
The director is coming.

359
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,173
I want you to make sure there's no trouble,

360
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,242
especially, Alex, come with me!

361
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,278
- Yes Nurse Rancette.

362
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,184
- Oh sheets.

363
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,322
- Find him!

364
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,257
If there is anything, anything amiss here

365
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,026
when the director arrives--

366
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,028
- You'll probably lose your job.

367
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,299
- Yes, and if I lose my job, then what happens to you?

368
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,135
- Um, I get a raise?

369
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,804
- Oh shut up, you lose yours, too.

370
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,440
Now find that child!

371
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,811
- [Dad] Hey, you sure you don't want any dinner?

372
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,513
- Yeah.

373
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,515
Dad, we can't leave the river.

374
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,183
- A lot of kids move.

375
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,785
At least you'll have some great memories.

376
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,887
- Like you have memories of Mom?

377
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,788
- Of course.

378
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,590
- It's not the same, is it?

379
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,225
I miss her.

380
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,594
- Me too, honey.

381
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,230
Hard to believe we were married, we were so different.

382
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,099
- Treasure hunter and the teacher.

383
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,534
- Just the facts for me,

384
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:26,438
but she loved the wild tales of the river.

385
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:30,842
She devoted herself to searching for that treasure.

386
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,145
- Lost Treasure of White River?

387
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,414
- But when you were born, she stopped.

388
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:40,118
Seemed you were the only treasure she really needed.

389
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,120
- Dad!

390
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,322
We could do it, you and me.

391
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,158
We could finish what she started.

392
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,560
- Molly, stop, there's no documentation

393
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,829
that the Army ever shipped gold on the river.

394
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,397
- Mom believed it, and Grandpa says

395
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,233
you have to have faith and stuff.

396
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,236
- You can't eat the things he's always spouting about.

397
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,140
Faith, truth, courage.

398
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,844
And it won't put a roof over your head.

399
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,379
Anyway, I need to get to bed.

400
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,081
I've got a job interview in the city tomorrow.

401
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,583
It'll be okay.

402
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,389
Better get to sleep.

403
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,225
By the way, I loved your speech.

404
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,794
Blaze of glory.

405
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,805
- [Cappy] In every journey, you've got to have three things,

406
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,875
faith, truth, courage.

407
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,845
Oh, and a little bit of luck.

408
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,348
- [Molly] That's four, faith, truth, courage, and luck.

409
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,453
- [Cappy] Well, you can't count on luck.

410
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,490
Believe in yourself, believe in the river.

411
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,995
And oh. (laughter)

412
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,731
Yessir.

413
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,733
- [Molly] Wow.

414
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,707
- When you start your journey, remember the legend.

415
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,409
- The legend?

416
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,846
- Indians used to tell a story about a spirit bear

417
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,349
that watched over the river.

418
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,819
It was a great big, old, mean bear.

419
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,989
Three toes.

420
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,224
- Is he mad about something?

421
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,994
- I don't know, it was a legend.

422
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,929
But they say that he was the guardian

423
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,565
of the river's treasures.

424
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,502
- I'd be too scared to go against that big bear.

425
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,438
There's no way, right, Cappy?

426
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:45,443
- Now, just remember, faith, truth, and courage.

427
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,855
(electronic screeches)

428
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:01,726
(rattling cans)

429
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,673
- [Voiceover] So let it be.

430
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:19,577
(electronic screeches) (rattling cans)

431
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,413
- Who's there?

432
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,783
(electronic screeches)

433
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,750
Hal?

434
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,119
- Greetings, Captain.

435
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,288
- [Molly] Are you okay?

436
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,158
- Neuromuscular 63%.

437
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,627
Vision, system failure.

438
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,295
- [Molly] What were you wearing?

439
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,897
- Night vision goggles.

440
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,765
This was the test run.

441
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,000
You can see in the dark.

442
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,902
(electronic screeches)

443
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,203
Sorta.

444
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,005
- Wait, say that again.

445
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,206
- Sorta?

446
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,109
- No, the part about seeing in the dark.

447
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,279
- Well, technically, they reflect

448
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,548
off the charged-coupled device.

449
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,085
- That's it, seeing in the dark.

450
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,988
River at night, mirrors clear as sight.

451
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,623
Your story told, the soldier's gold.

452
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,826
- That's really not the technical description.

453
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,960
- It's a riddle!

454
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,862
It's a clue to finding the treasure.

455
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,565
We have to find it, Hal, we have to.

456
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,333
It's the only way I can stay on the river

457
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,202
and save Grandpa's house.

458
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,437
(clunking)

459
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,639
Sh.

460
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:25,643
(dog barking) (electronic screeching)

461
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,391
(yelling)

462
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,694
- [Molly] You, what are you doing here?

463
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,731
- [Hal] Hey, navigational charts of the river.

464
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,266
- [Molly] My mom's research!

465
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,168
What are you doing in here?

466
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,103
- I just want to talk about your boat.

467
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,872
- [Molly] What about my boat?

468
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,509
- I just want to go downriver, a few miles,

469
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,843
and then I'd--

470
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,245
- [Molly] Steal my boat.

471
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,980
That's what you're trying to do.

472
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,117
- Nah, borrow it, come on.

473
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,421
- And just how were you planning to return it?

474
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,090
- Well, I'd...

475
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,727
- That's it, out, and stay off my boat.

476
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,795
- Sure, whatever.

477
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,731
- Hold it, what's that?

478
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,367
- Here.

479
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,037
Not bad reading once you get past the buried treasure parts.

480
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:28,606
- What is it?

481
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,175
- It's my mom's diary.

482
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:34,946
(nostalgic piano music)

483
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,417
They were clobbering us when Jillian raised the white flag.

484
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,820
It turned out to be a big pair of ladies' underwear.

485
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,190
- [Cappy] Oh, how'd those get in there?

486
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,892
- Then, my life, as I knew it, was over.

487
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,729
- Oh, I said the same thing when your grandmother

488
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,165
bought them drawers.

489
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,503
- And then they all started singing.

490
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:02,474
- Big underwear can have that effect on people.

491
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,143
Help you sir?

492
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,346
- Yes, I've come to visit Jacob Bradshaw.

493
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,647
Is this his room?

494
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,317
- Yeah, his granddaughter's in there with him.

495
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,122
- I found Mom's diary.

496
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,592
She was closer to finding the treasure than anybody knew.

497
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,060
And there's a map.

498
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,995
Mom's diary says there's someone named Bert

499
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,764
that can help us.

00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:30,101
We can make it in a day, you and me, Cappy.

501
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,138
- I'm afraid not, Molly.

502
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,373
I'm just so tired.

503
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,908
- I can't go without you.

504
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:39,444
- The river at night. - [Molly] Cappy.

505
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,314
- Soldier's gold. - [Molly] Cappy.

506
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,117
- I'm just so tired, Sara.

507
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,219
- Cappy, Cappy?

520
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,482
That old eyesore of a foster home gone.

521
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,285
The old Jacob Bradshaw house gone.

522
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,721
Hello, White River Papers.

523
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,390
Now, if I could just get my hands on that diary.

524
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,297
- Now what would they want with some old motor,

525
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,999
silly children.

526
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:11,402
You'd think they were going on some kind of cruise.

527
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,243
- [Molly] Come on, Jack, try it again.

528
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,781
(motor starting and sputtering out)

529
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,784
- Hal, can't you program something to make this work?

530
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,820
- If only it had an EEPROM.

531
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,189
Without the additional power,

532
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,558
our journey will be severely curtailed.

533
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,993
- What'd he say?

534
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,195
- We can't go.

535
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,698
- I'll never get downriver to find Bert.

536
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,101
- [Voiceover] Hello, Mr. Brown.

537
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,936
This is White River Nursing Home.

538
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,105
I'm calling about your father-in-law,

539
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,641
and we wanted to make sure Molly was all right.

540
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:53,645
Well, call us as soon as you get this message, please.

541
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,682
- Uh, uh, uh, Molly.

542
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,120
There's somebody in there.

543
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,725
- Hi.

544
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,394
- You again, don't you ever give up?

545
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,362
- [Jillian] It's that delinquent kid.

546
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,365
- Alex, name's Alex.

547
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,168
Well, I just want a ride out of here.

548
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,736
I can help, you know.

549
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,406
- [Molly] I suppose you know something about motors?

550
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,875
- Well, one of the loving foster homes I was in

551
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,245
was with this mechanic, a real prince.

552
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:31,516
I had to work in his garage or else no bed, no food.

553
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,621
You pick up stuff.

554
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,825
(light piano music)

555
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,298
- [Jillian] Okay, sleeping bags, check.

556
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,399
Food?

557
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,734
- Affirmative.

558
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:53,404
Highly adequate, proteinaceous sustenance.

559
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,972
- What did he say?

560
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,374
- He's got the food.

561
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,508
- Oh.

562
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,310
- Parental consent, accounted for?

563
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,713
- Check, all of your parents think you're at my house.

564
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,448
And my dad's away at a job interview.

565
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,884
- Except for...

566
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,955
- No worries, I don't have any parents.

567
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,824
- No worries, you're not going.

568
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,692
We can't risk that woman coming after us.

569
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:15,760
Thanks for the help.

570
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,962
But sorry, Alex.

571
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,766
- I'm gonna be grounded for life if my mom finds out

572
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,635
we're not sleeping at your house, Molly.

573
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:29,307
- GPS navigation system, Hal 9000 patent pending?

574
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,576
- [Voiceover] Hello, how are you?

575
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,845
- Check.

576
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,614
- [Jillian] Gas can?

577
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,919
- Check, and, uh, negative.

578
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,721
- What?

579
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,393
Great, this wrecks everything.

580
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,161
- [Alex] I know where some is.

581
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,596
- Where?

582
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,297
- There.

583
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,168
- Great, do we knock first, or ring the bell?

584
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,636
- Neither.

585
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,472
They'd never think I'm stupid enough to break back in.

586
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,174
- Isn't that stealing?

587
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:07,845
- I gave them the best 59 minutes and 20 seconds of my life.

588
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,715
Think of it as a trade.

589
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,851
- I'll go, you stay here.

590
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:18,356
- You know, technically, if we get caught, we're done.

591
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,158
Need these, Molly?

592
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,993
- [Jillian and Molly] No.

593
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,029
- [Hal] Just made a few minor adjustments.

594
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,900
(electronic pulses)

595
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,735
- Oh brother.

596
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,173
(dog barking) (suspenseful music)

597
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,675
- Stay here.

598
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,440
- Yes, Nurse Rancette.

599
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,977
Who's a good doggie.

600
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:17,014
You're a good doggie, yes you are.

601
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,985
(snoring)

602
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,620
(thudding)

603
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:29,327
This dream, oh, we were married this time.

604
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,563
Rancette babies.

605
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,700
Terminal bad hair, oh.

606
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,408
(suspenseful music) (barking)

607
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,654
- Let me have it.

608
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,056
- You don't take me with you, no gas.

609
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,792
- Fine, promise no more stealing.

610
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,793
- I promise.

611
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,594
- What?

612
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,529
- I promise!

613
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,097
- Sh.

614
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,067
- What is it now?

615
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,174
- Who's there?

616
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,112
- What's going on out there?

617
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,481
- I thought I heard someone, Nurse Rancid.

618
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,751
- Rancette, Simonton.

619
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,687
- I'm sorry, Nurse Rancette.

620
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,657
- Bed check, immediately.

621
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,429
What's that smell?

622
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,605
- What's the smell, let's see, it's you, Nurse Rancid.

623
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,216
- That smell was gas!

624
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,620
The kids, the motor, oh Simonton!

625
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,523
- [Jillian] They got caught, I just know it.

626
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,892
- [Jack] We're in big trouble.

627
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,028
- They've been gone approximately...

628
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,998
- [Voiceover] 13 minutes, seven seconds.

629
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,433
- Too long.

630
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:20,271
(mellow piano music)

631
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,347
- Honey, I'm home.

632
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,448
Slip me some skin.

633
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,149
- All right.

634
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,952
- Okay, let's shove off.

635
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,156
- It's all clear now, he's been hiding on that boat.

636
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,458
- Why would he do that?

637
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,926
- Because he's going downriver

638
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,894
with the rest of the children.

639
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,597
They must all be running away.

640
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,175
- Enemy approaching, and boy, does she look mad.

641
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,012
Or not. (electronic screeches)

642
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,814
Hal, I thought you fixed these.

643
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:10,187
(mystical music)

644
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,937
- Yes, this is Louis Turner.

645
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,573
Paul, I was in the area and I thought we could talk.

646
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,676
I'll try back later.

647
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:36,447
(mystical music)

648
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,992
- Nothing, the boat's gone.

649
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,696
- Jack, the motor will make noise.

650
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:59,837
- By my calculations, sound travels at 620 feet per second.

651
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,808
- Oh, the director's gonna have my head for this.

652
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,776
- Yes, Nurse Rancid, your head.

653
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,311
- Rancette.

654
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,546
Oh, shut up.

655
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,749
Call the sheriff, call the sheriff.

656
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,651
If my home isn't good enough for that boy,

657
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,220
maybe the big house will be.

658
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,689
- Stop it!

659
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,361
- [Molly] Okay, Jack, start the motor.

660
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,796
- Okay, got it.

661
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:30,701
(motor running and sputtering out)

662
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,003
Not good.

663
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,008
- Looks like we risked a criminal record for nothing.

664
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,650
- Try it now.

665
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,123
(motor running)

666
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,358
Don't panic.

667
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,028
- Great job.

668
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,131
Now we just need to figure out our coordinates.

669
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,967
- [Voiceover] Hello, I'm Hal 9000.

670
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,235
Nice to meet you.

671
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,837
We are now docking into Earth orbit nine,

672
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,107
(Spanish speaking)

673
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,278
- Perfect, we're headed in the right direction.

674
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,284
- Everything okay, Nurse Rancette?

675
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:24,088
- Oh, hello, Dr. Turner.

676
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,325
Just one small problem, one of our boys has run away.

677
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,362
- Yeah, and he stole my wallet.

678
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,397
- We believe he's headed downriver as we speak

679
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:36,967
with that awful bunch of river rats on their homemade boat.

680
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,235
- You mean Molly?

681
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,703
They're on Molly's boat?

682
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:43,974
- Yes, we saw them making ready for some kind of journey.

683
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,178
- Did they, do you know where they were going?

684
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,413
- No, but clearly they planned all along

685
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,216
to spirit away the boy. - [Simonton] Thief.

686
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,084
- We were just about the call the sheriff.

687
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,254
- Nurse Rancette.

688
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:02,626
- Beatrice, call me Beatrice.

689
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,964
- Beatrice, and you must call me Louis.

690
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,099
Why don't I help you run downriver?

691
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,703
I'm sure that we could intercept them at the first bridge.

692
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,607
Molly's father is a friend of mine,

693
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,010
and I'd hate to see them get into any trouble.

694
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,345
- And if we found them first,

695
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,814
we wouldn't have to tell the director about it.

696
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:28,486
- Oh, uh, well, I wouldn't want poor Mr. Brown

697
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,989
to experience any difficulties.

698
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,727
Perhaps you're right, Louis. (giggles)

699
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,797
Get in, Simonton.

700
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,701
(running motor)

701
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,605
- I'm looking for it, I'm looking for it, all right?

702
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,207
- Look at your fly! (giggling)

703
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,977
- It's on my fly, it's on my fly.

704
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:58,582
It's like, it's like you put a big spotlight on me.

705
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:02,286
- Wait, I don't remember a big brown spot on my underwear.

706
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,423
(laughter)

707
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,228
Spikes, wings, really weird things biting me.

708
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,864
(laughter)

709
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,942
- Molly, I'm trying to verify coordinates.

710
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,111
What's that rhyme?

711
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,382
- The river at night, mirrors clear as sight.

712
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,618
Your story told, the soldier's gold.

713
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,588
- Gold?

714
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,057
What gold?

715
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:41,926
- Never mind.

716
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,095
Get to sleep, I'll take first watch.

717
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,702
We have to stay in the middle of the river.

718
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,809
(suspenseful music)

719
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,985
- Night, honey.

720
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,664
(whimsical music)

721
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,005
- GPS, what direction are we headed?

722
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:31,475
- [Voiceover] 24 (Spanish language)

723
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,211
- That's not right, is it?

724
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,780
- [Voiceover] Five seven five latitude.

725
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,817
- I must have mixed programs in the download.

726
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,721
Spanish translator with global positioning.

727
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,558
- [Voiceover] Your direction is 2 (Spanish language)

728
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,193
- What does that mean?

729
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,495
- Your fly's open.

730
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,497
- it is not.

731
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,766
- Made you look.

732
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:06,710
(upbeat music)

733
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:23,861
(snoring)

734
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:30,300
- Oh, oh, Louis, I'm so sorry, oh how rude of me.

735
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,837
- It's quite all right, Beatrice.

736
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,440
Now, where's Simonton?

737
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,412
(whimsical music) (snoring)

738
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,449
- Simonton!

739
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:48,118
(yelling) (crashing)

740
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,523
- Did they pass here, yet?

741
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,425
- Not that I noticed.

742
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:58,429
- Oh you idiot, they're probably far ahead by now.

743
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,531
- I have an idea.

744
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,999
(phone dialing)

745
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:05,903
Mr. Farr, yes, this is Louis Turner.

746
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,272
Yes, hello.

747
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,774
We're very close, but I wanna make sure

748
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,743
that a certain little girl and her friends

749
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,180
don't find something that could

750
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,449
prove fortunate for them and unfortunate

751
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,085
for the White River Papers.

752
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:24,388
In a word sir, I need a boat.

753
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,793
Excellent, you'll be signing the papers by the weekend.

754
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,931
- That's a coincidence, Louis.

755
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,566
The president of the White River Papers

756
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,402
is to be a the foster home in two days.

757
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:42,606
- Yes, life is strange, isn't it, Beatrice?

758
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,877

Well, I can't say that I've ridden in anything

Oh!

00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,230

810
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,851
- [Jack] I'm starving, how about lunch?

811
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,420
- Yes, protein would be nice.

812
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,293
What's that?

813
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,729
- Hey, what's going on?

814
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,397
Jillian, the ropes!

815
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,399
Cut the motor, we're breaking up!

816
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,368
- We're about to get boarded.

817
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,136
What do you want?

818
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,971
- I think they're human.

819
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,006
- I think they're teenagers.

820
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:13,410
- Great, that's all we need, teenagers.

821
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,811
- Whaddya got?

822
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,747
- [Molly] Nothin' really.

823
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,083
- Then I guess we're just gonna have to take your boat.

824
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,285
- I don't like this.

825
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,554
- Hey, look.

826
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,089
- Hey, give those back.

827
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,825
- Just give them the stupid Twinkies, Jack.

828
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,494
- Look, beans.

829
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,697
- By my calculations, there are five of us,

830
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,832
and 20 of them.

831
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,000
- [Jillian] Jack.

832
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,803
- You don't know how painful this is.

833
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,674
- [Voiceover] You're not going anywhere.

834
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,810
- Hands off, creep.

835
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,813
(roaring)

836
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,715
- That sounded like a bear.

837
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,718
(roaring)

838
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,659
Can bears climb ropes?

839
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:08,064
- So, I don't think is just some fun on the water.

840
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,366
For Molly to take off like this after Cappy's--

841
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:10,867
(phone ringing)

842
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,502
- You might be right.

843
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,104
Sheriff Donnelly.

844
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,673
Right.

845
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,343
So, neither the groundskeeper nor the head nurse are there?

846
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,046
I see.

847
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,748
All right, thanks.

848
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,882
Seems we got a kid missing, too.

849
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,350
Alex, new arrival.

850
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,386
- Maybe they're all in this together somehow.

851
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,588
Molly's got this idea about a treasure.

852
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,957
- Yeah, I've heard that story since I was a kid.

853
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,892
That's what Cappy said,

854
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,295
"You have to have faith to find your truth,

855
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,429
"and the courage to follow it,"

856
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,564
is that it?

857
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,199
- Yeah, but she really believes it,

858
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,467
and I think she may be desperate enough

859
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,002
to do something dangerous.

860
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:57,047
- [Voiceover] A witch! (yelling)

861
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:03,720
- Would you quit that noise, please?

862
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,225
- She's very polite, for a witch.

863
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,260
- Ridiculous child.

864
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,729
- That it, no evil spells?

865
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,931
No fire coming out your nose?

866
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,300
- Was that you that made that bear noise?

867
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,735
- It's bear country.

868
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:21,471
I could tell you stories.

869
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,306
Best be on your way.

870
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,308
- [Molly] Bert?

871
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,744
- Yeah, how do you know me?

872
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,479
- You're Bert?

873
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,549
- Hm, short for Roberta.

874
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,817
And now you kids better get,

875
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,119
before those bad boys come back.

876
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,923
- But Bert, I'm Sara's daughter, Molly.

877
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,391
- Sara?

878
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,994
- Yes, I need to know the story of the treasure.

879
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,663
Cappy's been sick and we had to sell everything.

880
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,200
And move from the weather, and Cappy--

881
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,702
- Hey Molly, what's wrong?

882
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,704
- Molly?

883
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,540
- I see.

884
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,375
You come ashore.

885
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,912
The rest of you stay put, there's bears.

886
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,446
- How do you know?

887
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:08,184
- Same way I know lots of stuff, I'm old, you brat.

888
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:13,189
(guitar music)

889
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:20,330
(motorboat engine)

890
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,133
- Keep your eyes peeled, Paul.

891
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,267
We'll get there in time.

892
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,635
- [Paul] Can't you go any faster?

893
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,973
(guitar music)

894
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,950
- You look like your mother.

895
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:40,884
- [Molly] I do?

896
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,654
- Yeah, scruffy and earnest,

897
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,856
and pretty, too.

898
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,058
- Thanks.

899
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:52,495
- So, her father, your grandpa, huh?

900
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,097
- Gone.

901
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,733
- Oh well, that's too bad, huh.

902
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,869
Huh?

903
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,972
- What?

904
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:06,076
- All right, you wanna hear the story I told your mother?

905
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,879
- Yes, please.

906
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,385
- Did you know that your great-great grandma

907
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,755
had the treasure in her hand in 1864?

908
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,890
- No, really?

909
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,561
- Sure, strong women run in your family.

910
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:28,164
I'll tell ya, it wasn't long ago

911
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:29,699
that the terrible war between the states

912
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,636
was just about over.

913
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,139
It was a time of great desperation for the troops

914
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,409
as they prepared for one last battle.

915
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,878
Your great-great grandma was a doctor there.

916
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,381
Pretty rare in those days.

917
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,017
- Wow, she was cool.

918
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,452
- Yeah, a lot like you, kiddo.

919
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,022
As night fell, a guard brought up

920
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,325
a wounded prisoner for treatment.

921
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:00,263
The gold was the last hope for the wounded.

922
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,733
It could buy badly needed food and medicine.

923
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:09,139
As the prisoner approached, he saw the gold,

924
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,475
and he got some high hopes of his own.

925
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,981
With a battle upon him, the prisoner decided

926
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,984
to make his move for that gold.

927
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,357
There was a struggle.

928
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:30,327
The prisoner got the gun.

929
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,296
Shots rang out.

930
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,735
He left with the gun and the gold.

931
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,471
And now, your great-great grandma was wounded,

932
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,974
along with the others in the tent.

933
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,677
- So, what happened?

934
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,213
- Well, the trooper made his way down river

935
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,348
and was hiding the gold.

936
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:56,886
They say greed's always afraid to show its true face.

937
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:01,524
Many men suffered because he stole that gold,

938
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,127
but there's a legend about the spirit bear

939
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,929
that guards the river,

940
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,299
and sees to it that justice is done.

941
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:13,136
And that night, that prisoner met justice.

942
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,939
- [Molly] The three-toed bear?

943
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,808
- That's right, missy.

944
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,412
You afraid, girl?

945
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,347
Can't be afraid.

946
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,684
Who knows what happened to that trooper?

947
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,919
He didn't have the courage to face that bear

948
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,322
after what he'd done.

949
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,559
The prisoner and the gold were never seen again.

950
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,863
- [Molly] Is there a map?

951
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,065
- Well, I don't know, child.

952
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,738
I never had a map, myself. (creaking wood)

953
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,675
It's how come I never went after the treasure myself.

954
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,881
- Uh, hi.

955
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,550
- [Bert] What you doing here, sneaky boy?

956
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,852
- Molly, we were just worried about you.

957
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,154
- [Molly] I'm fine.

958
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,890
- There's nothin' for you to pinch here, kid.

959
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,358
- [Molly] How did you know?

960
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,060
Alex promised he wouldn't steal anymore.

961
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,564
- I, uh, I was in your shed, Molly.

962
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:17,801
I wanted to return it.

963
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,569
It was tucked in your mom's diary.

964
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:20,770
It's some kind of map.

965
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,372
- You stole it?

966
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:25,608
- Indeed it is, lookit.

967
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,611
This little island called Little Sue's is marked.

968
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,847
- Can you tell us how to get there?

969
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,649
- Sure, but,

970
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,719
I tell you who else is probably there.

971
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,421
- Three-toed bear.

972
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,958
I'm scared.

973
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,726
- You're in big trouble.

974
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:49,399
- It can be dangerous in there at night.

975
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,872
- [Jillian] Molly, do you think you can find this island?

976
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,009
- [Molly] Yeah, but it means we can't get back today.

977
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:02,078
- [Hal] Provisions, anyone?

978
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:02,979
- What?

979
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,615
- He means anybody hungry?

980
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,117
- Beans, is that it?

981
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,719
That's lunch?

982
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,588
That's all you brought?

983
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:14,724
- The bean, pound for pound, contains the most protein

984
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:18,027
in the smallest package, and can be eaten safely

985
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,996
at any temperature.

986
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,233
- Great, now we're all gonna be gas-powered.

987
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,401
- And me without my Twinkies.

988
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,071
- Even I could go for a Twinkie right now.

989
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,174
- Oh well, it's food.

990
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,947
- I think they must have taken the left fork back there.

991
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,149
- Now can you explain how the paper company

992
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,918
comes into all of this?

993
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,653
- Patience, my dear.

994
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:47,323
You might receive a very nice payoff with a little patience.

995
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,925
(farting)

996
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,793
- Made some more space.

997
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,128
- [Hal] Is that confirmed,

998
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,598
that there are bears in this area?

999
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:59,469
- Um, bears?

1000
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,975
- Lions and tigers and bears!

1001
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:08,044
- So funny, I forgot to laugh.

1002
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,446
- But you didn't forget to pee your pants.

1003
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,648
Made you look.

1004
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,816
- Would you quit doing that?

1005
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,019
- Hal, didn't you think that with all these beans--

1006
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:19,455
(farting) Whoops.

1007
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:22,492
- I never thought girls-- (farting)

1008
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,028
- The average person, male or female,

1009
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:28,197
breaks wind 16 times a day.

1010
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:31,000
- [Alex] You mean (farting) per minute.

1011
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,536
- [Voiceover] A common by-product of bean consumption

1012
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:35,171
by humans. (farting)

1013
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,706
- [Hal] Anything is possible.

1014
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:41,077
- [Alex] In the land of (farting) Fartzilla!

1015
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,480
- [Hal] Now that's going to leave a mark.

1016
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,649
- Right.

1017
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,451
They think they saw the hulk of a homemade boat

1018
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,019
a couple of hours ago.

1019
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,587
- How much further can we go by boat?

1020
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,256
- Well, quite a ways till the dam.

1021
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,024
Indians used to call it Wapahoni.

1022
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,225
- Wapahoni?

1023
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,994
- Yeah, it's the Indian word for mini falls.

1024
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,529
- There's no chance they'll get that close to the dam,

1025
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,730
right?

1026
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,433
- Well, let's find them before they find it.

1027
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,937
(motor starting)

1028
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,545
(gentle music)

1029
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,249
- [Alex] What's up with you?

1030
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,651
- [Molly] Nothin'.

1031
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,754
Really, nothing.

1032
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,790
Cappy died.

1033
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,727
- [Alex] Oh, I'm sorry.

1034
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,129
- [Molly] So, that'll just leave me and my dad.

1035
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,732
And if we have to move and leave the river,

1036
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,267
I won't have a home or

1037
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:42,171
my friends, and eveything will change.

1038
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:46,609
- [Alex] I guess that leaves me and you in the same boat.

1039
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,478
I'm sorry I stole that map.

1040
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,480
- That's all right, you gave it back.

1041
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,516
And besides, I still don't even know where we're going.

1042
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,717
And once we get there,

1043
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,754
I don't know how to find the treasure.

1044
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,922
And, there's a legend about a three-toed bear

1045
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,326
that'll eat you alive if you're afraid.

1046
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,364
- Well, that leaves you out.

1047
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,735
I've never met anybody as brave as you.

1048
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:13,636
- Really?

1049
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,004
- Mhmm.

1050
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:18,708
So, I'm with you to the island,

1051
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,512
to the treasure, up against the bear.

1052
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,947
Proud to serve, Captain.

1053
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,616
- Thanks, Alex.

1054
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,718
- But right now, I gotta go.

1055
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,053
- You goin' someplace.

1056
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,754
- I gotta go!

1057
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,189
- Just go over the side.

1058
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,758
- No, I gotta go.

1059
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:53,643
(ominous music)

1060
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:59,115
(roaring)

1061
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:04,720
- You're short.

1062
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,489
- Oh, that hurts.

1063
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,724
- What? - [Jillian] That really hurts.

1064
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,130
(growling)

1065
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,966
- Bravest person in the world, ha.

1066
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,635
Hey Alex, watch out for poison ivy!

1067
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,172
- What was that, two or three leaves?

1068
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:27,510
(growling)

1069
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,278
Hello?

1070
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:36,252
(roaring)

1071
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,287
Okay, bye.

1072
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,124
- [Cappy] Faith, truth, courage.

1073
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,225
- [Alex] Bear!

1074
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,693
- [Voiceover] Alert, big trouble.

1075
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,529
- [Alex] Bear, bear! (roaring)

1076
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,564
- Come on!

1077
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,502
- Come on you guys, quick! - [Jack] Come on, come on!

1078
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,370
- [Jack] Get on the boat, quick, there's a bear out there!

1079
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,747
(growling)

1080
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,721
- Do you need to stop, Simonton?

1081
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,593
- Shouldn't be too hard to catch up with them.

1082
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,295
- I hope not.

1083
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:30,606
- [Jack] Okay, first the gas, then the beans,

1084
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:34,844
then the gas, which came from the beans.

1085
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,213
Then a witch named Bert.

1086
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,449
- Molly, that diary won't help us find the treasure.

1087
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,786
- And not to mention, the bad kids.

1088
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,688
I just wanna go home.

1089
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:48,424
- But Cappy said, you have to have faith,

1090
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,326
truth, and courage.

1091
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:54,030
- [Jack] Did Cappy ever say anything about Twinkies?

1092
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,598
- [Molly] Jack!

1093
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,337
- Oh my God.

1094
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,640
- What do you have there?

1095
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,310
- Uh, nothing.

1096
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,713
But I think we're hot on their trail, come on.

1097
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,364
- It can be dangerous out here at night.

1098
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,234
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

1099
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:40,776
(peaceful orchestral music)

1100
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,562
- Can I see that?

1101
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,696
- Sure.

1102
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,131
I'm gonna do things when I grow up.

1103
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,967
I'm not gonna have a boring job.

1104
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,637
I'm gonna, travel the Sierra,

1105
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:10,473
sail all the Seven Seas, and go to Mars.

1106
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,476
- [Jack] Don't you think you're already on Mars, Molly?

1107
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,780
- Look what he's looking at.

1108
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:22,785
(jeering)

1109
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,957
- [Molly] Jack, I know you like them, but just stop.

1110
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,893
- There they are, finally.

1111
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,697
Louis, did you see that sign?

1112
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,865
- What sign?

1113
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,434
- The sign about the (rushing water).

1114
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:43,139
- River at night, mirrors clear sight.

1115
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:45,308
- What's that sound?

1116
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,610
- Here our story told.

1117
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,812
- [Voiceover] The medallion is highly protein.

1118
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,582
And the medallion is the map.

1119
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,084
- Wait!

1120
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,420
That's it, the medallion!

1121
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,456
- I hear a roar.

1122
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,158
- [Voiceover] You are moving in a--

1123
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,292
- Dam!

1124
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,294
Turn to shore!

1125
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,430
No, to shore!

1126
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,168
Over side, now!

1127
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:35,057
- [Voiceover] Wow, I guess (words drowned out by crashing)

1128
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,926
- Oh my goodness.

1129
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,828
Why don't we go pick them up?

1130
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,763
- Too late.

1131
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,901
- But Louis, did they all make it to shore?

1132
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,404
- That's what I'm worried about.

1133
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,439
- Where's Molly and Jillian?

1134
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:55,111
- I, I don't think they made it.

1135
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,313
- Come on.

1136
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:06,122
(suspenseful music)

1137
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,032
- I'm going to go into that cove over there.

1138
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,068
- [Molly] Are you okay?

1139
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,503
- [Jillian] Yeah.

1140
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:37,787
(new age music)

1141
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,722
- Molly!

1142
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,824
Molly?

1143
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,528
Molly!

1144
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,968
Oh, sorry.

1145
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,705
- Come on.

1146
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,878
I'm sorry I got you in this.

1147
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,281
We lost the map, the boat.

1148
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:07,950
We're cold, and it's dark.

1149
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,086
- And don't forget, we lost all of our beans over the dam.

1150
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:13,389
- Is your whole life food?

1151
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,157
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1152
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,859
We could have been killed.

1153
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,228
We're alive, and--

1154
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,564
- Well, we're waiting.

1155
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:24,733
- We're alive, did I say that already?

1156
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,435
- You're lucky you don't have parents,

1157
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,337
'cause mine are gonna kill me.

1158
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:32,341
- I'm real lucky, Jack, real lucky.

1159
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:37,346
- I just, I mean, sorry.

1160
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,181
- Wait a minute!

1161
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,951
The map, it's still around your neck!

1162
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,620
- It's not a map of the river, it's--

1163
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:47,389
- Of this island.

1164
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:51,961
And the markings indicate the location of the treasure.

1165
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,464
I'd say that we go right up this hill.

1166
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,066
- Let's go.

1167
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,106
- Think there's any wild animals out here?

1168
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,908
- Of course not, Simonton.

1169
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,309
Are there, Louis?

1170
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,311
- I'm gonna try to move quietly toward the young folks.

1171
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,813
I don't wanna scare them.

1172
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,883
- And I just wanna get my wallet back.

1173
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,786
And a slice of whatever it is you're into, Louis.

1174
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,121
- I don't know what you mean.

1175
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,656
- Sure you do.

1176
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,260
And if I don't get it, I blow the whistle on the whole deal.

1177
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,995
The fact that the paper mill's trying to buy up

1178
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,063
the Bradshaw property and the foster home

1179
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:29,999
so they can put a paper mill on the river.

1180
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,634
And the fact that you're trying to steal the treasure

1181
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:32,935
away from these kids.

1182
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,770
The whole deal.

1183
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:35,938
- What?

1184
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,106
Will somebody tell me what's going on?

1185
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,340
- Done.

1186
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,910
All right, everybody walk like a woodsman.

1187
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,112
I think they're up there.

1188
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,533
So, you know about the paper mill?

1189
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,068
- Everybody knows the paper company's

1190
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,070
wanted that stretch of land forever.

1191
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,506
And with Jacob Bradshaw in the nursing home,

1192
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,042
I could just see the vultures circling in.

1193
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,376
- Well, they'll have to sell now.

1194
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,145
Paul Brown's already agreed,

1195
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:19,582
and the foster home is next on the chopping block.

1196
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,383
- What?

1197
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:35,464
(growling)

1198
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,443
(coughing)

1199
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,414
- There should be a rock somewhere.

1200
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:58,153
- Uh, guys, look.

1201
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,622
A skull.

1202
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,724
- We need a light.

1203
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:06,028
- It's also a 60-decibel audible alarm.

1204
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,063
- Just the light, Hal.

1205
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,932
- Wow.

1206
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,672
Gold, just like in the museum.

1207
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:23,245
(growling)

1208
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:26,582
- Look, cloth from the Civil War.

1209
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,486
- The treasure must be here.

1210
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,387
- [Jack] Let's keep digging.

1211
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,288
- [Alex] Hold it.

1212
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,623
- [Molly] It's Dr. Turner.

1213
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,458
- Miss Rancette, come back for me.

1214
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:41,463
(roarling) (yelling)

1215
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,834
- That's Molly, come on.

1216
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,370
- [Voiceover] Molly, come on!

1217
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,339
- [Alex] Molly, he's guarding the treasure,

1218
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,874
it's not worth it.

1219
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:56,045
- Don't you see, courage is the only way.

1220
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:58,681
I can do this.

1221
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,685
Faith.

1222
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,287
Truth.

1223
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,523
Courage.

1224
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,593
(growling)

1225
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,665
(growling)

1226
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:39,388
(ominous music)

1227
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,691
- [Molly] Help!

1228
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,062
(roaring)

1229
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:52,901
(roaring)

1230
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,211
(roaring)

1231
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:12,521
(spooky music)

1232
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,463
- [Alex] Molly! Molly?

1233
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,705
Molly. Molly.

1234
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,007
- Here, in here.

1235
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,977
Bear gone?

1236
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,746
- [Alex] I hope so, my butt's sticking out.

1237
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,048
(laughing)

1238
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,383
Is that what I think it is?

1239
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,552
- Yup, faith, truth, and,

1240
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,687
help me drag it out.

1241
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:12,748
- Okay, now for the piece of resistance.

1242
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,216
- What?

1243
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,985
- It's French for open the sucker.

1244
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,121
- It's locked.

1245
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,990
- Get a big rock, and hit it.

1246
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,726
- Very scientific, Hal.

1247
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,868
- One more, there.

1248
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:37,473
(wondrous music)

1249
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,953
- We'll take over from here, kids.

1250
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:53,455
- Oh yeah? - [Simonton] Yeah.

1251
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,224
That's for taking my wallet.

1252
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,491
And now we'll be taking this,

1253
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:58,760
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1254
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,195
- [Jack] Finders keepers.

1255
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:04,666
- Yes, but we're the keepers and you're the weepers.

1256
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,769
Sadly, kids have no rights in this world, now do they?

1257
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,371
- Yeah, you...

1258
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,875
losers.

1259
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,509
- [Alex] Where's Nurse Rancette?

1260
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,912
- On the beach, a-scared of bears.

1261
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,280
- We'll tell everyone what happened.

1262
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,281
They'll believe us.

1263
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,549
- No they won't.

1264
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:22,784
Nobody believes this treasure ever existed.

1265
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,186
- What about the paper mill?

1266
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,854
It'll destroy the river.

1267
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,489
- Survival of the fittest.

1268
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,992
And I'll just take this and live quietly in,

1269
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,427
say, Las Vegas.

1270
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,695
- [Sheriff] Maybe Sing Sing.

1271
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,297
- [Paul] Molly!

1272
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,698
- Last time I checked, Louis,

1273
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,534
stealing from anybody was against the law.

1274
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,935
- [Jack] Got that right.

1275
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,470
- You kids all right?

1276
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,706
- Oh dear me, this is terrible.

1277
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,309
I'm gonna be out of a home and a job, too.

1278
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:51,079
- Now you know what it feels like, Nurse Ran--

1279
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:51,914
Rancette.

1280
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,082
- It's Ran--

1281
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,451
I'm sorry, Alex.

1282
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,587
Simonton!

1283
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,554
How could you?

1284
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:01,223
And Louis?

1285
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,625
Stealing from children.

1286
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,495
- Both of you better stay right where you're at.

1287
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,730
- I can't believe you left, I've been so worried about you.

1288
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,199
- Paul, you bring the kids and the nurse on down.

1289
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,901
Let's go, you two.

1290
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:15,470
- But I didn't do anything.

1291
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,674
I have a Ph.D., I'll have you know.

1292
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:21,576
- Fud, isn't that contagious?

1293
01:16:21,576 --> 01:16:22,778
- Not where he's going.

1294
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,212
Come on.

1295
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:30,519
- By my calculations, there's 3000 coins in there.

1296
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,888
At $20 each,

1297
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,258
that's $60,000.

1298
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,293
- [Jillian] Won't the government take it back?

1299
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,495
- I don't think so, river salvage laws.

1300
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,631
Something lost in the river's fair game.

1301
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:46,168
- I think we need to buy a foster home, too.

1302
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:49,771
To keep the paper mill from destroying the river.

1303
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,340
- Will we have enough?

1304
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,774
- These coins are pure gold

1305
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,343
and their historical value makes them worth

1306
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:58,013
at least $500-1000 apiece, I'd say.

1307
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,816
- That's three million dollars!

1308
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,318
- Oh wow. - [Molly] Whoa.

1309
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,887
- [Jack] We're all rich!

1310
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:13,795
- So, can Alex stay with us?

1311
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,665
- We'll see, honey, let's just get home.

1312
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:19,134
- That sounds good enough.

1313
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,704
- I'm getting too old for this.

1314
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:25,741
All I ever wanted was to have my own restaurant.

1315
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:28,443
I know a special way to cook tamales.

1316
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:30,846
- [Alex] Maybe I could make you, Beatrice.

1317
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,948
- Oh, please call me Bea--

1318
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,251
Thanks, Alex.

1319
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,220

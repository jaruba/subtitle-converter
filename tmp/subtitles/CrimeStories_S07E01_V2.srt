1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,371
(Narrator) MARCH 2000.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,239
POLICE IN KANSAS
FOLLOW THE CLUES

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,142
BEHIND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
A STRING OF YOUNG WOMEN,

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,878
CLUES THAT SOON LEAD THEM
TO THE ONLINE WORLD

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,880
OF SEX AND BONDAGE.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,849
(Brad Hill) IT WAS QUITE A
SHOCK TO US - OBVIOUSLY -

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,251
TO FIND OUT ABOUT
THESE WEBSITES.

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,856
THERE WAS PROBABLY MUCH
GREATER FOLLOWING IN THIS

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,858
THAN WHAT WE WOULD
HAVE EVER DREAMED.

10
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,327
BEFORE LONG, A GROWING
SQUAD OF DETECTIVES

11
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,230
CLOSES IN ON THE WORLD'S
FIRST CYBER-KILLER,

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,400
A MAN KNOWN TO SOME
AS SLAVE MASTER.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,435
(Brad) HE JUST DEVELOPED
INTO THIS PERSON

14
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,272
THAT COULD KILL PEOPLE
WITHOUT REMORSE.

15
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,609
ALONG WITH POLICE,
THERE ARE THOSE

16
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,345
WHO CHRONICLE THE
INVESTIGATION UP CLOSE -

17
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,281
ON FILM, ON
PAPER, AND ON TAPE.

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,517
THEY ARE THE PUBLIC'S
FIRST WITNESS.

19
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,885
THROUGH THEIR EYES,

20
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:56,356
THEY CAPTURE OUR DARKEST
CHAPTERS OF CRIME.

21
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:26,453
(♪)

22
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,391
IN THE LATE 1990s, THE
INTERNET WAS GROWING

23
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,027
AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE.
WITHIN A FEW YEARS,

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,762
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
WERE SUDDENLY USING

25
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,831
THEIR COMPUTERS TO
KEEP IN TOUCH WITH FAMILY

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,033
AND FRIENDS, MEET
NEW ACQUAINTANCES,

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,736
EVEN SHOP OR LOOK
FOR A JOB ONLINE.

28
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,873
AT THE TIME, A YOUNG
WOMAN FROM MICHIGAN

29
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,576
NAMED SUZETTE TROUTEN WAS
AMONG THOSE EMBRACING

30
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,411
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY.

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,679
(camera shutter click)

32
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,615
SUZETTE TROUTEN
WAS A, A GAL

33
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,851
IN HER MID-TWENTIES.
SHE WAS VERY MUCH

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,686
INTO COMMUNICATING
OVER THE INTERNET,

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,987
VERY MUCH INTO E-MAILING,

36
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,490
VERY MUCH INTO INSTANT
MESSAGING, YOU KNOW,

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,759
AS WAS HER CORE
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS.

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,629
DURING THE DAY, SUZETTE
WORKS AS A NURSE'S AID

39
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,365
AND A COOK AT A
LOCAL RESTAURANT.

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,702
IN DECEMBER OF 1999,
WHILE AT HER COMPUTER,

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,072
SHE GETS WHAT SEEMS LIKE
AN INCREDIBLE BREAK.

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,075
SUZETTE MEETS A NEW FRIEND
AND POTENTIAL EMPLOYER

43
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,712
OVER THE INTERNET. JOHN
ROBINSON, OR JR AS HE OFTEN

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,616
GOES BY WHILE ONLINE,
LIVES NEAR KANSAS CITY.

45
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,917
(camera shutter click)

46
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,154
HE HAD OFFERED
SUZETTE TROUTEN A JOB

47
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,257
AT $67,000 DOLLARS
A YEAR TO SORT OF BE

48
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,361
A PRIVATE NURSE TO
HIS AILING FATHER.

49
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,530
FOR SOMEBODY LIKE
SUZETTE TROUTEN,

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,568
WHO'D BEEN WORKING AS A, AS
AN AID IN NURSING HOMES

51
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,304
IN MICHIGAN WHERE SHE
WAS FROM - $67,000 DOLLARS

52
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:56,476
A YEAR WAS A FANTASTIC SUM
OF MONEY THAT WAS MORE

53
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,679
THAN SHE'D PROBABLY EVER BE
ABLE TO MAKE UP THERE.

54
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,282
ALTHOUGH SOME FAMILY MEMBERS
FEEL THE JOB OFFER

55
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,750
IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,

56
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,553
SUZETTE FEELS INCLINED
TO ACCEPT IT.

57
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,955
SHE SAYS GOODBYE TO
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

58
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,025
AND MAKES THE MORE THAN
700 MILE DRIVE TO KANSAS,

59
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,295
HER TWO SMALL DOGS
PEKA AND HARRY IN TOW.

60
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,702
JOHN ROBINSON GREETS HER
AND SETS HER UP IN LENEXA,

61
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,672
NOT FAR FROM KANSAS CITY.

62
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,074
FOR THE FIRST FEW WEEKS,

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,977
SUZETTE STAYS IN CLOSE TOUCH
WITH THOSE BACK HOME,

64
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,581
ESPECIALLY HER
MOTHER CAROLINE.

65
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,149
(camera shutter click)

66
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,618
SUZETTE HAD CONTACTED
HER MOTHER AND I BELIEVE

67
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,321
IT WAS EVERY SINGLE
DAY THAT SHE WAS HERE

68
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,790
SHE HAD, SHE WOULD CALL
EVERYDAY OR E-MAIL EVERYDAY

69
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,159
AND THERE WAS CONSTANT
COMMUNICATION.

70
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,231
BUT ON MARCH 1, 2000, THAT
CONTACT SUDDENLY STOPS.

71
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,334
CAROLINE RECEIVES NO
NEW CALLS OR E-MAILS

72
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,635
FROM HER DAUGHTER,

73
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,870
AND THE ATTEMPTS SHE
MAKES TO CONTACT SUZETTE

74
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,373
BRING NO REPLIES.

75
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,875
(Gerald Hay) THEY
WERE QUITE CLOSE.

76
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,446
WHEN SHE, YOU KNOW, THE
COMMUNICATIONS LINE

77
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,249
WERE QUICKLY SEVERED,
HER MOM IMMEDIATELY

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,451
KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

79
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,887
SUZETTE'S MOTHER CONTACTS
JOHN ROBINSON DIRECTLY.

80
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,990
HE EXPLAINS THAT HE TOO
HASN'T BEEN IN TOUCH

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,259
WITH SUZETTE FOR
SEVERAL DAYS.

82
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,261
HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT
SHE NEVER ACTUALLY TOOK

83
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,263
THE NURSING JOB HE OFFERED.

84
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,732
INSTEAD, SHE TOOK OFF
ON AN EXTENDED HOLIDAY

85
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,002
WITH A WEALTHY LOCAL
LAWYER NAMED JIM TURNER.

86
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,472
(David) CAROLINE HAD NEVER
HEARD JIM TURNER BEFORE,

87
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,841
SUZETTE HAD NEVER TALKED
ABOUT JIM, JIM TURNER

88
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,845
BEFORE. SUZETTE WOULD NEVER
TAKE OFF WITH SOMEONE

89
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,013
SHE HAD JUST
MET LIKE THAT;

90
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,281
THAT WAS TOTALLY
OUT OF CHARACTER

91
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,316
FOR WHAT CAROLINE
KNEW SUZETTE TO BE.

92
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,917
SHORTLY AFTER
THE PHONE CALL,

93
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,919
SUZETTE'S MOTHER AND
OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS

94
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,023
BEGIN RECEIVING E-MAILS
FROM SUZETTE AGAIN.

95
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,159
SHE SEEMS TO CONFIRM
JOHN ROBINSON'S STORY.

96
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,029
WITH HER DOGS PEKA AND
HARRY STILL AT HER SIDE,

97
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,598
SHE EXPLAINS SHE IS NOW
TRAVELLING OVERSEAS

98
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,533
WITH HER NEW
ACQUAINTANCE.

99
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,137
(David) THE THING THAT
CAROLINE AND OTHER FAMILY

100
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,139
MEMBERS NOTED ABOUT
THESE E-MAILS

101
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,408
IS THAT THEY WEREN'T WRITTEN
THE WAY THAT SUZETTE WRITES.

102
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,244
(Brad) ONE OF THE
DOG'S NAMES WAS
SPELLED INCORRECTLY.

103
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,547
AND SO THEY, THEY KNEW JUST
FROM THE WAY SHE WROTE,

104
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,249
THIS IS NOT FROM HER.

105
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,951
ALONG WITH THE
SUSPICIOUS E-MAILS,

106
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,687
FAMILY MEMBERS
ALSO RECEIVE

107
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,523
TYPEWRITTEN LETTERS
FROM SUZETTE.

108
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,259
(Paul) THE STYLE OF WRITING
WAS DIFFERENT FROM HER,

109
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,428
BUT YET WHAT WAS PERPLEXING
TO THEM WAS THAT HER

110
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,263
SIGNATURE WAS ON
THESE LETTERS.

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,998
THEY WERE TYPEWRITTEN,
BUT HER SIGNATURE

112
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,100
WAS ON ALL THESE LETTERS.

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,336
AND SO THEY DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT TO THINK,

114
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,706
BUT HER MOM WAS INSISTENT ON
THE FACT THAT SOMETHING HAD

115
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,275
HAPPENED TO SUZETTE AND THAT
SHE REALLY WASN'T TRAVELLING

116
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,478
WITH THIS GUY 'CAUSE IT
JUST DIDN'T QUITE FIT.

117
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,647
MARCH 25, 2000.

118
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,349
AFRAID THAT SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED

119
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,018
TO SUZETTE, HER SISTER
DAWN CONTACTS POLICE

120
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:56,189
IN KANSAS TO FILE A
MISSING PERSONS REPORT.

121
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,457
(camera shutter click)

122
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,494
WHEN WE GET A MISSING
PERSON REPORT IT'S SO HARD

123
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,730
TO TELL WHAT MAY HAVE
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

124
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,233
A LOT OF TIMES THE PEOPLE
DON'T WANT TO BE FOUND.

125
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,035
SHE WAS OUT OF TOWN, SHE
COULD HAVE BEEN IN ANOTHER

126
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,471
TOWN AT THAT TIME, SHE COULD
HAVE MET SOMEBODY ELSE,

127
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,842
IT CAN BE ANY ONE OF A
MILLION DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

128
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,945
FOLLOWING UP ON THE REPORT,
POLICE VISIT THE HOTEL

129
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,581
WHERE SUZETTE WAS
ORIGINALLY STAYING.

130
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,384
SUZETTE WAS LAST
SEEN ON MARCH 1st,

131
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,419
THE VERY DAY REGULAR
COMMUNICATION

132
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,390
WITH HER FAMILY
FIRST DROPPED OFF.

133
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,326
(David) THE STAFF AT THE
HOTEL SAID JOHN ROBINSON

134
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,330
CHECKED SUZETTE OUT. AND
JOHN ROBINSON WAS SEEN

135
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,899
COMING BACK IN HIS
TRUCK THAT AFTERNOON

136
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,868
REMOVING
HER BELONGINGS.

137
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,405
THEY HAVE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE
TAPE RUNNING 27/7.

138
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,508
THE VIDEOTAPE
SHOWING JOHN THE DAY

139
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,278
HE CHECKS SUZETTE
OUT OF THE HOTEL.

140
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,781
THE FACT THAT JOHN ROBINSON
WAS THE LAST PERSON

141
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,351
SEEN WITH SUZETTE'S
POSSESSIONS RAISES
POLICE INTEREST.

142
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,053
FURTHERMORE, THEY CAN FIND
NO RECORD OF A WEALTHY LOCAL

143
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,089
LAWYER NAMED JIM TURNER,

144
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,359
THE MAN SUZETTE
ALLEGEDLY RAN OFF WITH.

145
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,727
BACK AT THE STATION,

146
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,263
THEY UNCOVER MORE
DISTURBING INFORMATION.

147
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,532
POLICE RECORDS REVEAL THAT
SUZETTE'S PROSPECTIVE

148
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,636
EMPLOYER JOHN ROBINSON IS
ACTUALLY A CAREER CON MAN

149
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,673
WITH A CRIMINAL HISTORY
INVOLVING FRAUD AND THEFT.

150
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,642
(Paul) WHEN WE LOOKED
AT HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN

151
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,077
SCAMMING PEOPLE
SINCE HE WAS A KID.

152
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,080
HE WAS VERY GOOD AT IT, HE
WAS ABLE TO TALK PEOPLE INTO

153
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,917
GIVING HIM LARGE QUANTITIES
OF MONEY OF COURSE

154
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,219
THEY'D NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

155
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,455
MOST OMINOUS, HOWEVER,
IS THE FACT THAT JOHN

156
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,291
ROBINSON'S NAME IS ALSO
FLAGGED IN CONNECTION

157
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,093
WITH THREE OTHER MISSING
PERSONS CASES DATING BACK

158
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,229
TO THE 1980s.

159
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,398
(Paul) WE HAD ALL THESE
WOMEN THAT SPAN BACK ALMOST

160
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,769
20 YEARS AND THE ONE THING
THEY HAD IN COMMON IS THEY

161
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,772
HAD ALL HAD AN ASSOCIATION
WITH JOHN ROBINSON,

162
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,141
AND DURING THAT ASSOCIATION
WITH JOHN ROBINSON

163
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,677
THEY'D ALL DISAPPEARED.

164
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,112
(Brad) THE MINUTE THAT
THEY SAW THAT THEY JUST,

165
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,583
YOU KNOW, HAD A BAD FEELING
ABOUT IT: THAT THIS ISN'T,

166
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,418
THIS ISN'T LOOKING
GOOD, THIS IS ANOTHER,

167
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,487
THE PATTERN IS CONTINUING.

168
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,057
(Paul) LITERALLY WITHIN 24
HOURS WE HAD PUT TOGETHER

169
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,627
A TASK FORCE THAT WORKED
OUT OF THE LENEXA POLICE

170
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,230
DEPARTMENT THAT INVOLVED
SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGENCIES

171
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,500
AND WITHIN 24 HOURS WE WERE
MEETING AND COMING UP WITH

172
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,335
A GAME PLAN ON WHAT WE WERE
GONNA DO TO INVESTIGATE

173
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,339
THIS GUY AND, AND FIND
OUT WHAT THE TRUTH WAS.

174
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,508
(David) WE STARTED TALKING
AND SINCE WE'RE LOOKING

175
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,611
FOR SUZETTE AND WE KNOW
THAT SUZETTE IS ASSOCIATED

176
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,714
WITH JOHN ROBINSON, WE SAY,
OKAY, MAYBE THE BEST WAY

177
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,449
TO FIND SUZETTE IS IF
SHE'S ALIVE, IS TO START

178
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,351
SURVEILLING JOHN ROBINSON.

179
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,753
MAYBE JOHN ROBINSON WILL
TAKE US TO SUZETTE;

180
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,556
WE MAY GET SOME INDICATION
ABOUT WHERE SHE'S AT.

181
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,628
MARCH 29, 2000.

182
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,829
WITH GROWING UNEASE

183
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,098
ABOUT THEIR LATEST
MISSING PERSONS CASE,

184
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,300
POLICE BEGIN TAKING
A MUCH CLOSER LOOK

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,169
AT 56-YEAR-OLD
JOHN ROBINSON.

186
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,539
AT THE TIME, HE LIVES
WITH HIS WIFE NANCY

187
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,275
IN A LOCAL MOBILE
HOME COMMUNITY.

188
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,912
(Dan) EVERYDAY I WOULD MEET
A GROUP OF DETECTIVES;

189
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:10,917
WE WOULD ALL BE IN VEHICLES
THAT ARE SOMEWHAT LOW-PROFILE.

190
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,553
WE DRESSED DOWN IN
CASUAL CLOTHES.

191
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:18,024
OUR DETECTIVES WOULD HAVE
AN EYE ON HIS TRAILER

192
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,394
AND THE TRAILER PARK AND
WHEN HE WOULD START MOVING

193
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,129
WE WOULD FOLLOW HIM.

194
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,199
AT THE SAME TIME,

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,869
POLICE EMPLOY ANOTHER
INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

196
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,405
KNOWN AS TRASHING.

197
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,407
(Dan) WE WERE JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HABITS

198
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,776
OF JOHN ROBINSON WERE. SEEING
IF THERE WERE ANY CLUES

199
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,679
ABOUT THIS MISSING GAL
WAS IN HIS TRASH.

200
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,582
WE GENERALLY WENT BY THERE
EARLY MORNING HOURS.

201
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,052
(David) WE'LL REPLACE
GARBAGE BAG THAT WE WANT

202
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,522
WITH VERY SIMILAR-LOOKING
GARBAGE BAG SO THAT THE NEXT

203
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,593
MORNING, JOHN OR WHOEVER
IT MAY BE YOU KNOW,

204
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,330
SEES IT OUT THERE AND THE,
THE TRASH PEOPLE PICK IT UP.

205
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,365
(Dan) THE FIRST TIME WE
PICKED UP THE TRASH

206
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,435
HE'D SHREDDED A LOT OF
THE CONTENTS OF HIS TRASH

207
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,070
THROUGH THE PAPER SHREDDER.

208
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,972
(Brad) SO YOU HAD
THESE STRIPS OF PAPER

209
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,807
THAT YOU COULD TRY
AND MATCH UP.

210
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,442
YOU CAN SEPARATE BY
COLOR AND YOU KNOW,

211
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,911
IF THERE'S THINGS ABOUT THE
PAPER MAKE IT UNIQUE YOU CAN

212
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,813
OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT
GOES WITH THAT.

213
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,349
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
IT'S THE BIG PUZZLE.

214
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,085
AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE
TAPE ONE TO THE TABLE

215
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,120
AND THEN WE JUST TRY
AND KEEP TAPING PIECES

216
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,990
TO IT UNTIL WE GET
THE FULL DOCUMENT.

217
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,025
MOST OF THE GARBAGE
IS QUITE ORDINARY,

218
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,094
WITH NO LINKS TO
SUZETTE TROUTEN.

219
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,997
ON THE SURFACE AT LEAST,
JOHN ROBINSON LOOKS LIKE

220
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,565
THE LAST PERSON
TO BE INVOLVED

221
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,101
IN A MISSING
PERSONS CASE.

222
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,570
(Dan) WE DIDN'T SEE HIM
DOING A LOT OF THINGS

223
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,106
THAT WOULD RAISE THE
SUSPICION OF ANYONE.

224
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,575
HE WAS, HE WAS A FATHER,
HE WAS A GRANDFATHER.

225
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,277
WE SAW HIM ONE TIME
PICK UP HIS CHILD

226
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,279
AT A DAYCARE CENTER.

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,383
WE SAW HIM MAKE TRIPS
TO HARDWARE STORES,

228
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,953
MAKE TRIPS TO RESTAURANTS
WITH HIS WIFE.

229
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,855
A LOT OF THE THINGS HE DID
WERE JUST ORDINARY THINGS

230
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,758
THAT ORDINARY
PEOPLE DO EVERYDAY.

231
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,494
BUT IN THE DAYS AHEAD,
LINKS TO A WORLD OF SEX

232
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,864
AND BONDAGE AND A
MYSTERIOUS STORAGE LOCKER

233
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:09,135
MAY LEAD DETECTIVES TO
28-YEAR-OLD SUZETTE TROUTEN.

234
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,036
(♪)

235
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,338
(Narrator)
MARCH 31, 2000.

236
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,140
IN JOHNSON
COUNTY KANSAS,

237
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,043
POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR
MISSING SUZETTE TROUTEN,

238
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,145
A NURSE'S AID
FROM MICHIGAN.

239
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,514
ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO
EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY,

240
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,449
THE LAST PERSON KNOWN
TO HAVE SEEN HER

241
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,987
IS A 56-YEAR-OLD LOCAL
RESIDENT NAMED JOHN ROBINSON.

242
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,523
A CAREER CONMAN WHO IS
LINKED TO AT LEAST THREE

243
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,426
OTHER MISSING PERSONS CASES,
ROBINSON IS NOW UNDER

244
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,994
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE.

245
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,564
POLICE HOPE HE MAY LEAD THEM
TO SUZETTE'S WHEREABOUTS.

246
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,732
(camera shutter click)

247
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,069
(Brad) WE JUST KIND OF
DID EVERYTHING WE COULD

248
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,538
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT,
WHERE, YOU KNOW,

249
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,474
WHAT'S GOING ON
AND HOW DO WE GET TO

250
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,910
THE BOTTOM OF, YOU KNOW,
WHERE IS THIS GIRL.

251
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,713
WHILE SOME OFFICERS
KEEP WATCH ON ROBINSON,

252
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,848
OTHER OFFICERS GO TO
MICHIGAN TO SPEAK WITH

253
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,552
SUZETTE'S MOTHER CAROLINE
AND COMPILE A DETAILED LIST

254
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,288
OF SUZETTE'S PERSONAL
POSSESSIONS.

255
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,658
(Brad) WE JUST DECIDED THAT
IF A PERSON WHO MOVED HERE

256
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,359
AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY
WAS MISSING.

257
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,228
IF SHE WAS GONE MISSING
AND HER PROPERTY WAS GONE,

258
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,031
SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO PUT
THIS PROPERTY SOMEWHERE.

259
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,300
THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT
YOU COULD GET RID OF THAT

260
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,503
OR YOU WOULD YOU, YOU NEED TO
PUT IT INTO A STORAGE FACILITY

261
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:21,107
SO LITERALLY WE JUST DECIDED
THAT'S A LEAD WE NEED

262
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:25,478
TO LOOK INTO, SO WE OPENED
A PHONEBOOK AND JUST WENT

263
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,047
RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THE
PHONEBOOK CALLING ANY,

264
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,750
ANY STORAGE FACILITY
THAT WE COULD FIND.

265
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,119
POLICE DON'T FIND
ANY STORAGE LOCKERS

266
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,754
UNDER SUZETTE
TROUTEN'S NAME,

267
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,690
BUT THEY DO FIND ONE
BELONGING TO JOHN ROBINSON

268
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,760
IN THE NEARBY CITY
OF OLATHE, KANSAS.

269
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,896
CURIOUSLY, IT APPEARS
ROBINSON VISITED THE SITE

270
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,233
ON MARCH 1st, THE SAME DAY
SUZETTE WAS LAST SEEN

271
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,337
AT HER HOTEL. A SIMILAR
LEAD MATERIALIZES

272
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,506
IN ROBINSON'S
SHREDDED TRASH.

273
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,876
OFFICERS RE-ASSEMBLE A BILL
FOR ANOTHER STORAGE LOCKER

274
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,145
IN RAYMORE, MISSOURI,
THIS ONE HELD IN

275
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,149
JOHN'S WIFE'S NAME.
PAYING A VISIT,

276
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,620
POLICE LEARN THAT JOHN
ALSO HAS HIS OWN STORAGE
LOCKER THERE.

277
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,790
ALTHOUGH POLICE FEEL THE
STORAGE LOCKERS MAY HOLD

278
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,825
CLUES ABOUT SUZETTE'S
WHEREABOUTS,

279
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,161
THEY ARE UNABLE TO LOOK
INSIDE WITHOUT SOLID

280
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,463
EVIDENCE AND A
SEARCH WARRANT.

281
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,366
(♪)

282
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,634
(camera shutter click)

283
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,737
WE HAD ACTUALLY SET
UP SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

284
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,840
ABOVE THE ENTRYWAYS OF
BOTH STORAGE LOCKERS.

285
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,177
SO THAT WE COULD KEEP TRACK
OF HIM WHEN HE DID SHOW UP

286
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,379
THERE. IF WE WERE TO LOSE
HIM ON OUR SURVEILLANCE

287
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,281
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL
WHETHER OR NOT HE WENT

288
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,284
TO THAT LOCKER OR NOT
BY VIEWING THE TAPES

289
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,287
ONCE WE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.

290
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,657
AT THE SAME TIME,
HOPING TO FIND LINKS,

291
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,393
POLICE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT
THE OTHER MISSING PERSONS

292
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,063
CASES THAT ROBINSON HAS BEEN
CONNECTED TO IN THE PAST.

293
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,933
ONE DATES BACK
TO THE MID-1980s.

294
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,468
A 19-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
NAMED LISA STASI

295
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,938
AND HER FIVE MONTH OLD BABY
TIFFANY WERE REFERRED

296
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,407
TO A PROGRAM IN KANSAS
AIMED AT HELPING YOUNG

297
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,076
SINGLE MOTHERS GET
BACK ON THEIR FEET.

298
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,681
AT THE TIME, IT HAPPENED TO
BE RUN BY JOHN ROBINSON.

299
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,949
(camera shutter click)

300
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,486
HE HAD AN APARTMENT
THAT HE WAS USING

301
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:20,593
FOR THIS PROGRAM THAT HE WAS
ALLEGEDLY RUNNING FOR YOUNG

302
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:26,165
GIRLS. BUT INSTEAD OF
PUTTING LISA AT THE SITE

303
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:32,371
OF HIS PROGRAM HE
PUT HER IN A MOTEL.

304
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,975
HER FAMILY HAD RECEIVED A
CALL FROM HER WANTING TO

305
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,745
KNOW WHY THEY WERE TRYING
TO TAKE HER BABY AWAY,

306
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,747
AND THEY SAID WE'RE NOT
TRYING TO TAKE YOUR BABY

307
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,550
AWAY, AND SHE'S CRYING
AND SHE'S HYSTERICAL,

308
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:49,755
SHE'S A YOUNG, 19-YEAR-OLD
YOUNG WOMAN AND SHE SAYS

309
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,625
THEY'VE MADE ME SIGN FOUR
BLANK SHEETS OF PAPER,

310
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,561
HERE THEY COME,
I HAVE TO GO.

311
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,264
AND THOSE WERE THE
LAST WORDS THAT ANYONE

312
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,201
EVER HEARD FROM
LISA STASI.

313
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:08,140
THE FAMILY DOES, HOWEVER,
RECEIVE A SIGNED LETTER.

314
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,843
(Stephen) AND BASICALLY,
THE LETTER SAID,

315
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:15,047
"I'M OKAY, I'VE, I'VE MET
SOMEONE ELSE, I'VE GONE OFF

316
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,117
TO START A NEW LIFE", YOU
KNOW, "I APPRECIATE THE HELP

317
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,921
I'VE RECEIVED FROM ROBINSON,
FROM THE ORGANIZATIONS

318
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,856
THAT HAVE HELPED ME
OUT BUT I'VE JUST,

319
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,492
I'M JUST GONNA GO
START A NEW LIFE."

320
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:32,031
(♪)

321
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,434
IN THE 1980s, PROBATION
OFFICER STEPHEN HAYMES MET

322
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,772
WITH ROBINSON TO DISCUSS HIS
PROGRAM FOR SINGLE MOTHERS.

323
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,408
(Stephen) HE HAD A LONG
CRIMINAL HISTORY ALREADY

324
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,577
BY THAT TIME: HE HAD
EMBEZZLED FROM,

325
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:51,350
FROM EMPLOYERS, HE HAD STOLEN
FROM, FROM SEVERAL EMPLOYERS.

326
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,954
JOHN JUST PROCLAIMED HIS
INNOCENCE OR INVOLVEMENT

327
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,690
IN ANY WAY WITH LISA, OTHER
THAN HELPING HER OUT.

328
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,159
SHE'S GONE OFF
WITH A BOYFRIEND,

329
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,895
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY HE'S
BEING HASSLED AND BOTHERED

330
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,365
BY PEOPLE QUESTIONING HIM
WHEN ALL HE TRIED TO DO

331
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,534
WAS SOMETHING GOOD.

332
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,337
COMPOUNDING SUSPICIONS,
HAYMES LEARN THAT ONLY

333
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,340
SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO LISA
STASI'S DISAPPEARANCE,

334
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,842
AN EMPLOYEE OF ROBINSON'S
NAMED PAULA GODFREY

335
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,711
ALSO WENT MISSING.

336
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,815
HER FAMILY HAD RECEIVED
SIMILAR SIGNED LETTERS.

337
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:27,286
(Stephen) IT WAS TO ME MORE
THAN A STRANGE COINCIDENCE

338
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:33,993
THAT YOU HAVE TWO MISSING
PERSONS AND SIMILAR

339
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,562
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ALL OF
A SUDDEN LETTERS START

340
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,099
APPEARING SIGNED BY
HER, SAYING THAT,

341
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,835
"I'M OKAY, I'M FINE, I'VE
JUST DECIDED TO GO OFF

342
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,636
AND START A NEW LIFE."

343
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,773
YOU KNOW THAT WAS
MORE COINCIDENCE

344
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,410
THAN I WAS WILLING
TO ACCEPT.

345
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,579
AT THE TIME,
HAYMES SPECULATED

346
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,481
THAT JOHN ROBINSON
MIGHT BE INVOLVED

347
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,484
IN A BABY SMUGGLING OR
PROSTITUTION RING.

348
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,319
POLICE INVESTIGATION
REVEALED THAT HE HAD

349
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,390
A SEXUAL FETISH FOR BDSM,
SHORT FOR BONDAGE,

350
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,960
DOMINATION, AND
SADOMASOCHISM.

351
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,330
BDSM IS A ROUGH FORM OF
SEX THAT OFTEN INVOLVES

352
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,266
WHIPS AND RESTRAINTS.
AT LEAST ONE WOMAN

353
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,335
IS ON RECORD WITH CLAIMS
THAT ROBINSON

354
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,406
HIRED HER OUT TO MEN WHO
SHARED SIMILAR FETISHES.

355
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,276
(Stephen) SHE ALSO TELLS US
A STORY THAT ROBINSON

356
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,548
IS INVOLVED IN A GROUP
THAT PROVIDES GIRLS

357
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,886
FOR SADOMASOCHISTIC
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

358
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:38,057
AND THAT HE PAID HER
A LARGE SUM OF MONEY

359
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,925
AND THAT HE GAVE
HER SOME DRUGS,

360
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,694
BLINDFOLDED HER,
PUT HER IN A CAR

361
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,732
AND DROVE HER TO A, TO
A HOUSE IN A, IN A VERY

362
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:51,703
AFFLUENT PART OF TOWN AND
THAT SHE WAS TAKEN TO

363
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,372
THE BASEMENT OF THIS HOUSE,

364
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,476
AND IN THE BASEMENT
OF THE HOUSE THERE WERE

365
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:04,750
RACKS AND OTHER S &
M-TYPE TORTURE DEVICES.

366
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,553
WHILE A WOMAN NAMED
CATHERINE CLAMPITT WOULD

367
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,090
ALSO VANISH AFTER MEETING
ROBINSON IN THE 1980s,

368
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,125
THERE WAS NEVER ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO CHARGE HIM

369
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,562
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
OF THE MISSING WOMEN.

370
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,830
(camera shutter click)

371
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,666
(Gerald) THERE WAS
SUSPICIONS BUT ACT,

372
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,402
NO ACTUAL PROOF THAT
ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED

373
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:28,040
TO THESE WOMEN. NO ONE HAD ANY
PROOF THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG.

374
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,476
FOR POLICE NOW SEARCHING
FOR SUZETTE TROUTEN

375
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,144
IN THE YEAR 2000,

376
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,879
THERE ARE FRIGHTENING
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN

377
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,982
THE OLD FILES AND HER
RECENT DISAPPEARANCE,

378
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,751
IN PARTICULAR, THE
BIZARRE SIGNED LETTERS,

379
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,588
LETTERS THAT
CONTINUE TO COME.

380
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,856
(camera shutter click)

381
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,758
SHE'D WRITE THESE
ELABORATE LETTERS ABOUT,

382
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,627
"I'M ON THE DECK
THIS MORNING,

383
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,064
WE'RE WATCHING THE DOLPHINS
SWIM ALONGSIDE THE BOAT AND

384
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,633
OUR TWO LITTLE DOGS PEKA AND
HARRY ARE OUT HERE BARKING

385
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:58,770
AT THE FISH" AND NONE OF
THESE LETTERS MADE SENSE

386
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,772
TO HER FAMILY BECAUSE
HER MOM KNEW THAT

387
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,276
SHE DIDN'T LIKE WATER.

388
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,379
(David) THEY KNEW THIS COULD
NOT BE COMING FROM SUZETTE.

389
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,617
MOREOVER, A GRIM LEAD SEEMS
TO CONTRADICT THE LETTERS

390
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:16,522
AND CONFIRM FEARS THAT
SUZETTE NEVER LEFT KANSAS.

391
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,191
OFFICERS LEARN THAT TWO DOGS
MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION

392
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,660
OF PEKA AND HARRY WERE
RECENTLY PICKED UP

393
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,662
BY A LOCAL ANIMAL SHELTER.

394
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,198
TO MAKE A COMPARISON,
OFFICERS USE PHOTOS

395
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,169
OF THE DOGS PROVIDED BY
SUZETTE'S MOTHER CAROLINE.

396
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,537
(camera shutter click)

397
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,839
CAROLINE TELLS ME THAT
THOSE TWO DOGS,

398
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,642
PEKA AND HARRY,
WERE, WERE HER KIDS.

399
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,278
SUZETTE WOULD GO NOWHERE
WITHOUT PEKA AND HARRY AND,

400
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,848
SHE SAYS IF YOU FIND PEKA
AND HARRY WITHOUT SUZETTE,

401
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,485
SHE KNOWS SOMETHING
IS SERIOUSLY WRONG.

402
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,822
ONE DOG HAS BEEN GIVEN UP FOR
ADOPTION TO A LOCAL FAMILY.

403
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,958
(Brad) I WENT TO THEIR
HOUSE AND I TOLD THEM WHY

404
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,861
I WAS THERE AND THEY WERE
VERY HELPFUL, VERY FRIENDLY.

405
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,963
I TALKED TO 'EM FOR AWHILE,
I LOOKED AT THE DOG,

406
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,299
I SHOWED 'EM THE PICTURE,
THEY AGREED IT LOOKED LIKE

407
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,436
THIS DOG PEKA AND THEN AFTER
I TALKED TO 'EM FOR AWHILE

408
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,506
I CALLED THE DOG BY NAME AND
IT CAME RIGHT OVER TO ME

409
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,309
SO WE JUST ALL, AND WE
KNEW THEN THAT WAS,

410
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,511
THAT WAS PEKA.

411
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,948
SUZETTE'S OTHER DOG HARRY
TURNS UP AT ANOTHER SHELTER.

412
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,851
(David) I FLEW UP TO TO
MICHIGAN AND MET WITH

413
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,954
CAROLINE AT HER HOUSE AND
DELIVERED THE NEWS

414
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,056
TO CAROLINE THAT YOU KNOW,
WE HAD FOUND PEKA AND HARRY

415
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,724
AND DESCRIBED THE
CIRCUMSTANCES.

416
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,593
AND THAT, THAT HIT
HOME PRETTY HARD.

417
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,163
YOU COULD TELL CAROLINE, YOU
KNOW, SAT BACK AND SAID,

418
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,800
"THEN THAT MEANS THAT
SUZETTE'S PROBABLY DEAD".

419
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,069
SO SHE REALIZED AT THAT
POINT THAT IT WAS VERY,

420
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,905
YOU KNOW, THE CHANCES OF
SUZETTE BEING FOUND ALIVE

421
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,740
WERE SLIM TO NONE.

422
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,243
(Paul) IT BECAME VERY,
VERY OBVIOUS TO US

423
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,380
THAT THIS GUY WAS
PROBABLY KILLING WOMEN.

424
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,649
BUT WITHOUT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
AGAINST ROBINSON

425
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,883
FOR AN ARREST WARRANT,

426
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,720
POLICE CAN DO LITTLE MORE
THAN WATCH AND WAIT.

427
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,456
NEW ANSWERS WILL SOON
COME FROM THE INTERNET -

428
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,459
AND FROM A STREAM OF NEW
WOMEN THAT JOHN ROBINSON

429
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,095
STARTS BRINGING INTO TOWN.

430
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:09,368
(♪)

431
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,905
(Narrator)
APRIL 2000.

432
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,742
POLICE IN KANSAS ARE
KEEPING A CONSTANT WATCH

433
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,745
ON 56-YEAR-OLD
JOHN ROBINSON.

434
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,780
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NO
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM,

435
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,049
HE IS THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN THE DISAPPEARANCE

436
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,018
OF AT LEAST FOUR
YOUNG WOMEN;

437
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,654
MOST RECENTLY A
28-YEAR-OLD NURSE'S AID

438
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,489
NAMED SUZETTE TROUTEN.

439
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,757
(camera shutter click)

440
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:37,296
WE NEVER REALLY HAD SOLID
INFORMATION THAT ANYTHING,

441
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,131
OTHER THAN THE FACTS
THAT SHE'S MISSING.

442
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,399
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

443
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,534
WE KNEW SHE WAS WITH THIS
GUY AND WE DON'T KNOW

444
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,036
WHAT HE MAY HAVE
DONE WITH HER;

445
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,238
SHE MIGHT BE ALIVE,
SHE MIGHT BE DEAD.

446
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,674
POLICE TAILING ROBINSON
LEARN THAT ALONG WITH

447
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,776
KEEPING STORAGE
LOCKERS IN THE AREA,

448
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,245
HE ALSO HAS A HIDEOUT
FAR FROM THE MOBILE HOME

449
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,448
COMMUNITY HE LIVES
IN WITH HIS WIFE.

00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,683
(camera shutter click)

451
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,620
ON ONE OCCASION
MR. ROBINSON WAS FOLLOWED

452
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,824
AND HE'D BEEN GOING FOR
QUITE A WAYS DOWN SOUTH

453
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,794
AND HE EVENTUALLY ENDED
UP IN LA CYGNE, KANSAS,

454
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,630
WHICH, AND IT WAS QUITE
A WAY TO TRAVEL.

455
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,899
AND THEY SAW HIM DRIVE
ON TO A PROPERTY.

456
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,635
IT WAS JUST A PROPERTY
THAT HAS SMALL POND ON IT,

457
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,372
HAD A TRAILER ON IT AT THE
END OF THE LONG DRIVEWAY.

458
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,841
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAS INSIDE OF THERE.

459
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,644
BUT WE KNEW THAT
SINCE HE DID VISIT IT,

460
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,280
WE BELIEVED THAT TO BE
A POSSIBLE LOCATION

461
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,983
FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO SUZETTE TROUTEN.

462
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,218
(camera shutter click)

463
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,823
THERE WAS A FAIRLY
SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME

464
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,825
WHERE WE HAD OUR SUSPICIONS
AND WE HAD REAL STRONG

465
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,094
BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING
ON BUT WE COULDN'T PROVE IT.

466
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,130
BUT IN THE INTERIM WE HAD TO
BUILD OUR CASE AND MAKE SURE

467
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,667
THAT HE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY
WHILE WE WERE WATCHING HIM.

468
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,836
SOME FEEL THE STRONGEST
LEADS TO DATE

469
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,738
REST IN THE VARIOUS
LETTERS RECEIVED BY

470
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,474
SUZETTE'S FAMILY, THE
ONES SUPPOSEDLY WRITTEN

471
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,110
BY THEIR MISSING DAUGHTER.

472
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,478
(camera shutter click)

473
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,382
TO, TO TRACE MAIL
LETTER CORRESPONDENCE

474

YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE,
THE POSTMARK, YOU KNOW ON,

475
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,855
ON THE ENVELOPE. THAT'S
GOING TO TELL YOU THE CITY

476
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,490
AND THE STATE
OF ORIGIN.

477

THERE'S ALSO SOME CODES
IN THERE THAT'LL HELP YOU

478
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,961

00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,697
OR THE ORIGINAL
POST OFFICE.

480
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,867
CURIOUSLY, THE POSTMARKS
ALL CORRESPOND

481
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,170
TO THE DISTANT LOCATIONS
SUZETTE CLAIMS TO BE IN.

482
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,639
AT THE VERY LEAST, SOMEONE
IS DROPPING THEM OFF

483
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:32,544
AT POST OFFICES A LONG WAY
FROM JOHNSON COUNTY, KANSAS.

484
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:35,881
(Paul) THE TRICK WAS
FIGURING OUT WHERE

485
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,616
THEY WERE COMING FROM.

486
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,618
IT ISN'T LONG, HOWEVER,
BEFORE DETECTIVES MAKE

487
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,787
A STRIKING BREAKTHROUGH
REGARDING SUZETTE'S

488
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,790
SUSPICIOUS E-MAILS. THEY
PIECE TOGETHER BILLS

489
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,892
IN THE TRASH THAT
PROVIDE DETAILS ABOUT

490
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,561
JOHN ROBINSON'S INTERNET
SERVICE PROVIDER.

491
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,930
POLICE REALIZE THAT
AS OF MARCH 1st,

492
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,299
THE VERY DAY SUZETTE'S
REGULAR COMMUNICATION

493
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,736
DROPPED OFF, ALL NEW E-MAILS
ALLEGEDLY FROM HER ACTUALLY

494
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:03,008
EMANATED FROM JOHN
ROBINSON'S ACCOUNT AT
HIS RESIDENCE.

495
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,912
(David) WE KNEW THAT
JOHN WAS ACCESSING

496
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:10,382
SUZETTE'S INTERNET ACCOUNT
FROM HIS RESIDENCE.

497
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,184
JOHN ROBINSON WAS
THE ONE SENDING

498
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,553
THESE FICTITIOUS E-MAILS.

499
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,823
ROBINSON'S ONLINE ACTIVITY
ALSO REVEALS ACCESS

500
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,759
TO INTERNET SITES
RELATED TO BDSM,

501
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,828
A LONG-STANDING
FETISH OF HIS,

502
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:27,599
WHERE HE OCCASIONALLY USES
THE NICKNAME MIDWEST-MASTER.

503
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,769
(Brad) IT WAS QUITE A SHOCK
TO US OBVIOUSLY TO FIND OUT

504
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:36,208
ABOUT THESE WEBSITES.
IT'S A MASTER, SLAVE,

505
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,578
BONDAGE AND
DISCIPLINE SEX ACTS.

506
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:48,320
AND IT INVOLVES PROPS,
AND CONTRACTS AND
SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

507
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,890
POLICE LEARN THAT MISSING
SUZETTE TROUTEN

508
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,060
WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN
THE BDSM LIFESTYLE.

509
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,795
POLICE WONDER IF
HER DISAPPEARANCE

510
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,531
MAY SOMEHOW BE RELATED
TO A CRIMINAL STRAIN

511
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,334
OF THIS ONLINE SUBCULTURE.

512
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,970
(David) THERE WERE
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SEX SLAVES

513
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,874
AND ABOUT PEOPLE BEING
KIDNAPPED AND TAKEN INTO SEX

514
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,343
SLAVERY AND IN THE BACK OF
OUR MINDS WE'RE WONDERING,

515
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,345
OKAY, IS THAT SOMETHING
WE'RE INTO HERE?

516
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,549
ARE WE INTO, YOU KNOW,
A SEX SLAVE RING?

517
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:22,821
COULD ANYONE ELSE BE
INVOLVED IN, YOU KNOW,

518
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,523
HARBORING SUZETTE?

519
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,025
IN, IN KIDNAPPING, IN, IN
CHASING HER AWAY OR TAKING,

520
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,828
CARRYING HER AWAY TO BE
A SEX SLAVE SOMEWHERE?

521
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,897
CERTAINLY WITH THE B.D.S.M.

522
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,166
ASPECTS OF IT THAT, THAT
WAS A REAL POSSIBILITY.

523
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,469
THE FACT THAT ROBINSON
HAS CLEARLY ACCESSED

524
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,738
SUZETTE TROUTEN'S E-MAIL
ACCOUNT COULD PROVIDE

525
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,107
POLICE WITH A SEARCH
WARRANT FOR HIS HOME,

526
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,277
BUT NOT FOR HIS STORAGE
LOCKERS OR HIS FARM,

527
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:50,282
THE MOST LIKELY PLACES TO
HIDE INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE.

528
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,684
(David) WHEN YOU REACH
A POINT TO, YOU KNOW,

529
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,953
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW FOR
SURE IF SUZETTE'S ALIVE,

530
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,422
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW FOR
SURE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE

531
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:01,493
INVOLVED, YOU REACH A POINT
WHERE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY

532
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,330
CO-CONSPIRATORS, YOU MONITOR
TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS.

533
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,333
WITHIN DAYS, THERE IS A
SUDDEN NEW DEVELOPMENT.

534
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,936
POLICE TRACKING NUMBERS
DIALLED FROM ROBINSON'S CELL

535
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,338
PHONE REALIZE HE IS
CONTACTING WOMEN LIVING

536
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,874
IN DIFFERENT STATES AND
ARRANGING TRAVEL PLANS

537
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,877
TO KANSAS. THROUGH
HIS ONLINE PERSONA,

538
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:22,514
IT APPEARS JOHN ROBINSON,
A.K.A. MIDWEST-MASTER,

539
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,084
IS ABOUT TO BRING MORE
WOMEN INTO TOWN.

540
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,820
(Paul) HE WOULD CONTACT
THEM TRY TO SEE IF THEY WERE

541
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,889
INTERESTED IN
COMING DOWN HERE.

542
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,458
HE HELD HIMSELF OUT AS
SOME KIND OF A MASTER,

543
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,962
IF YOU WILL, IN BONDAGE AND
DISCIPLINE AND WOULD OFFER

544
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,532
TO TRAIN THESE WOMEN AND
ASK THEM TO BE HIS SLAVE.

545
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,234
HIS ONLINE TACTICS BEAR
A STRONG SIMILARITY

546
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,437
TO THOSE THAT BROUGHT
SUZETTE TROUTEN TO KANSAS

547
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,739
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER.

548
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,375
(Paul) BUT HE WOULD ADD A
FLAVOUR TO THAT BY TELLING

549
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,545
THEM THAT HE WAS A VERY,
VERY RICH EITHER DIVORCED

550
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,648
OR WIDOWED BUSINESSMAN THAT
HAD ALL THESE CONNECTIONS

551
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,651
AND THAT HE WOULD SET
THEM UP WITH A JOB HERE

552
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,720
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM.

553
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,723
IN THE DAYS AHEAD, POLICE
WILL GET THEIR CLOSEST

554
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,826
LOOK YET AT THE
UNDERGROUND WORLD OF BDSM.

555
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,729
AND MEET A WOMAN WHO
BARELY ESCAPED BECOMING

556
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,931
A MISSING PERSON HERSELF.

557
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,834
(♪)

558
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,370
(Narrator)
APRIL 2000.

559
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,139
IN KANSAS, POLICE ARE
INVESTIGATING THE CASE

560
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,108
OF MISSING
SUZETTE TROUTEN,

561
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,744
A 25-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
FROM MICHIGAN.

562
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:29,314
PRIME SUSPECT IS LOCAL
RESIDENT JOHN ROBINSON,

563
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,951
HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE
BONDAGE AND S & M SUBCULTURE.

564
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,953
POLICE WATCH AS HE
ACTIVELY SETS UP

565
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,123
SEXUALLY RELATED MEETINGS
WITH NEW ACQUAINTANCES

566
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,025
FROM OUT OF TOWN.

567
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,526
APRIL 24th.

568
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,762
A YOUNG WOMAN NAMED
VICKIE FROM TEXAS

569
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,665
ARRIVES IN OVERLAND PARK,
KANSAS AND CHECKS INTO

570
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:50,301
A LOCAL MOTEL ROOM
RESERVED BY ROBINSON.

571
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,436
(camera shutter click)

572
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,906
VICKIE WAS ANOTHER
WOMAN THAT, YOU KNOW,

573
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,344
HE WAS - HE HAD MET ONLINE.
VICKIE HAD COME IN TO BE

574
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:03,448
PART OF THE B.D.S.M.
LIFESTYLE WITH HIM.

575
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,152
SHE HAD, I GUESS WHAT WE
REFER TO AS HER OWN BAG

576
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,622
OF TRICKS. YOU KNOW,
B.D.S.M. INVOLVES DIFFERENT

577
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,258
TOYS, TOOLS -
THINGS LIKE THAT.

578
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,794
SHE HAD BROUGHT SOME
OF THAT ALONG WITH HER.

579
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,929
POLICE WATCH AS JOHN
ROBINSON ARRIVES

580
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,632
AT THE MOTEL AND HEADS
UP TO THE ROOM.

581
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,068
SOON AFTER, VICKIE
APPROACHES THE FRONT DESK

582
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,271
CLERK AND ASKS IF SHE CAN
HAVE A PHOTOCOPY MADE.

583
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,339
THE CLERK, AWARE OF THE
POLICE SURVEILLANCE,

584
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,009
MAKES AN EXTRA COPY OF THE
DOCUMENT AND HANDS IT OVER

585
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,545
TO UNDERCOVER OFFICERS
ON THE PREMISES.

586
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,281
IT TURNS OUT TO BE A
DETAILED SLAVE / MASTER

587
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,085
CONTRACT, POPULAR
IN BDSM CIRCLES.

588
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:44,456
(♪)

589
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,557
(camera shutter click)

590
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,760
IN THE B.D.S.M.
WORLD OFTEN TIMES

591
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,762
THESE PEOPLE WOULD COME
UP WITH THESE ELABORATE

592
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,833
CONTRACTS ABOUT THE
CONDITIONS OF THE CONTRACT

593
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,368
TO BE SOMEBODY'S SLAVE
AND SOMEBODY'S MASTER,

594
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,671
AND OF COURSE JOHN ROBINSON
BEING THE CONTROL FREAK

595
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,040
THAT HE IS WAS
ALWAYS THE MASTER.

596
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,410
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT
ARE IN TO BDSM ARE REALLY

597
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,115
INTO THE WHOLE SCENE SETTING
IF YOU WILL OF SOMEBODY

598
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:14,385
IN CONTROL OR SOMEBODY
BEING DOMINATED I THINK

599
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,690
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE KINDA GOT
OFF JUST ON THE CONTRACTS.

600
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,126
HOPING TO ENSURE VICKIE'S
SAFETY WITHOUT GIVING UP

601
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,062
THEIR COVER, OFFICERS
QUIETLY TAKE UP POSITIONS

602
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,765
IN ADJACENT ROOMS.

603
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,066
(camera shutter click)

604
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,702
(Brad) THE OFFICERS THAT
WERE ON THE SCENE HAD TO

605
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,905
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THIS
PERSON THAT HE'S MEETING,

606
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,542
ISN'T OUR MISSING GIRL, BUT
WE ALSO NEED TO FIND THIS

607
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,545
MISSING GIRL AND IS THIS
WOMAN WHO'S MEETING HIM SAFE,

608
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:45,617
CAN WE ENSURE HER SAFETY
IN THAT ROOM WITH HIM?

609
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,919
OFFICERS HEAR
FREQUENT NOISE,

610
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,255
BUT THEY HAVE TO DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN THE NORMAL VIOLENCE

611
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,091
THAT OFTEN GOES ALONG
WITH BDSM ACTIVITIES

612
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,161
AND A POTENTIAL
REAL THREAT.

613
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,297
(Paul) YOU'D HAVE OFFICERS
IN THE NEXT ROOM LISTENING

614
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,032
AND SOMETIMES THERE'D
BE HITTING AND A LOT

615
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:05,170
OF HOLLERING GOING ON WE'RE
TRYING TO DISCERN WHETHER

616
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,173
OR NOT THAT'S CONSENSUAL
PLAY KINDA STUFF

617
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,441
OR IF HE'S REALLY
HURTING THESE WOMEN.

618
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,378
AND SO THERE WERE A LOT OF
DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN

619
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,213
THAT INVESTIGATION.

620
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:20,752
AFTER THREE DAYS, VICKIE,
APPARENTLY UNHARMED,

621
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,921
HEADS HOME FOR TEXAS.

622
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,757
OTHER WOMEN SOON
TAKE HER PLACE.

623
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,193
(Paul) HE'D BE GOING TO
HOTELS MEETING WITH WOMEN,

624
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,762
E-MAILING PEOPLE,
SO ON SO FORTH,

625
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,031
AND AS SOON AS HE WOULD GET,
AS SOON AS HIS WIFE WOULD

626
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:36,568
GET HOME AT ABOUT FIVE IN
THE AFTERNOON ROBINSON WOULD

627
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,138
COME HOME AND HE'D BE
HUSBAND AND A GRANDPA

628
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,974
TO HIS GRANDKIDS AND JUST
A NORMAL ACTING GUY

629
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:48,413
EXCEPT FOR A 9-5
DURING THE WORK DAYS.

630
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,481
POLICE SURVEILLANCE
IS CONSTANT,

631
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,217
BUT ON ONE BRIEF OCCASION,

632
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:56,054
ROBINSON SLIPS AWAY WHILE
DRIVING ACROSS TOWN.

633
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,488
(camera shutter click)

634
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,726
WE LOST SIGHT OF HIM,
WE, WE COULDN'T PICK HIM

635
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,596
BACK UP AGAIN AND WE
EVENTUALLY FOUND HIM BACK

636
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,731
AT HIS RESIDENCE.

637
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,967
ONLY LATER, WHILE ROUTINELY
REVIEWING TAPES

638
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,368
BACK AT THE STATION,

639
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,504
ARE THEY ABLE TO
FILL IN THE MISSING GAP.

640
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,074
(Dan) WE WERE ABLE TO TELL
BY VIEWING SOME SURVEILLANCE

641
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,444
FOOTAGE AT A STORAGE LOCKER
THAT DURING THAT TIME FRAME

642
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,714
HE HAD PAID VISIT TO
THAT STORAGE LOCKER.

643
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,884
AND WE JUST HAPPENED TO SEE
HIM WALK IN TO THE STORAGE

644
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,253
LOCKER HOLDING A BAG.

645
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,389
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A
BLACK SOFT-SIDED BAG,

646
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,259
BRIEFCASE SIZE MAYBE A
LITTLE THICKER THAN THAT.

647
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,027
AND WHEN HE WALKED OUT OF
THE STORAGE LOCKER HE DID

648
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,630
NOT HAVE IT WITH HIM.

649
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:44,135
WHILE SOME BELIEVE THE BLACK
BAG POSSIBLY CONTAINS

650
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,372
SEX TOYS, OTHERS SPECULATE
IT MAY ALSO CONTAIN

651
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,275
POTENTIAL MURDER WEAPONS.

652
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,378
(Paul) THERE WAS ALMOST
DAILY DEBATE ON WHEN

653
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,214
TO ARREST HIM, BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,

654
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,682
IT'S EASY TO
ARREST SOMEBODY,

655
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,550
BUT WHEN YOU ARREST SOMEBODY
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

656
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,153
A CASE THAT YOU
CAN PROVE IN COURT.

657
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:11,796
MAY 19, 2000.
A WOMAN NAMED JEANNA

658
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,432
ARRIVES IN TOWN TO
MEET WITH ROBINSON.

659
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,302
WITHIN HOURS, THERE APPEARS
TO BE A FALLING OUT.

660
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:22,607
(David) JOHN LEAVES JEANNA
AND JEANNA BEGINS TO BECOME

661
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,509
CONCERNED ABOUT
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

662
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,945
THAT SHE'S PLACED
HERSELF IN.

663
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,348
IN A STRIKING DEVELOPMENT,
JEANNA APPROACHES

664
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,517
THE FRONT DESK
OF THE HOTEL.

665
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,252
AFTER SPEAKING
WITH THE STAFF,

666
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,688
SHE ASKS THEM TO
PHONE THE POLICE.

667
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,057
THE CALL IS PROMPTLY ROUTED
TO OFFICERS IN CHARGE

668
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,626
OF THE SURVEILLANCE.

669
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,062
JEANNA TELLS POLICE SHE IS
WORRIED BECAUSE THE MAN

670
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,065
SHE CAME TO TOWN TO MEET HAD
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER

671
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,833
AND USED A FALSE NAME,

672
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,436
SOMETHING SHE DISCOVERED
FROM THE HOTEL STAFF.

673
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:55,073
THE NAME HE ORIGINALLY
GAVE HER IS JIM TURNER;

674
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:58,076
THE SAME NAME ROBINSON GAVE
SUZETTE TROUTEN'S FAMILY

675
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,611
TO IDENTIFY THE MYSTERY
MAN SHE HAD APPARENTLY

676
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:05,383
RUN OFF WITH. AS POLICE
HAVE LONG SUSPECTED,

677
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:11,622
JIM TURNER AND JOHN ROBINSON
ARE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON.

678
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,826
NOT LONG AFTER POLICE MOVE
JEANNA TO A SAFE LOCATION,

679
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,729
THE WOMAN KNOWN AS VICKIE
ALSO CONTACTS THEM.

680
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,198
SHE REPORTS THAT JOHN
ROBINSON HAS STOLEN

681
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,201
HER SEX TOYS AND REFUSES
TO RETURN THEM.

682
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,204
WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS, TWO
WOMEN HAVE PROVIDED POLICE

683
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,107
WITH ALL THE PROBABLE CAUSE
THEY NEED TO MOVE IN

684
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,477
AND SEARCH ROBINSON'S
VARIOUS PROPERTIES.

685
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,045
(Paul) THEY WENT TO THE
POLICE INDEPENDENTLY

686
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,581
OF EACH OTHER AND
REPORTED HIM FOR THEFT

687
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,383
AND AGGRAVATED
SEXUAL BATTERY,

688
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,485
WHICH WAS A BIG, BIG
BREAK IN THE CASE FOR US,

689
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,488
JUST AT A TIME WHEN
WE NEEDED IT THE MOST.

690
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,524
JUNE 1, 2000. POLICE
TAKE UP POSITIONS

691
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,527
AROUND JOHN ROBINSON'S
MOBILE HOME COMMUNITY.

692
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,763
SHORTLY AFTER HIS WIFE
LEAVES FOR THE DAY,

693
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,599
THEY DECIDE TO
MAKE THEIR MOVE.

694
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,602
(Brad) HE WAS CONTACTED AT
HIS MOBILE HOME THAT MORNING

695
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,604
AND TWO DETECTIVES WENT
UP AND TALKED TO HIM.

696
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,040
AND, AND THEY ACTUALLY
WENT IN THE TRAILER

697
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:06,411
AND HE - THEY EVENTUALLY GOT
AROUND TO THE, YOU KNOW,

698
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,913
TELLING HIM THEY NEEDED
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT SOME

699
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,616
CRIMES AND HE, THEY TOLD HIM
THESE, WHAT THE CRIMES WERE,

700
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,252
WHAT HE WAS GOING
TO BE ARRESTED FOR.

701
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:18,356
THE CHARGES RELATE TO
JEANNA AND VICKIE

702
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:21,426
AND INCLUDE AGGRAVATED
SEXUAL BATTERY AND THEFT.

703
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,628
ROBINSON SEEMS EMBARRASSED
AND PLAYS DOWN

704
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,264
THE INCIDENTS, BUT THE
MOOD IN THE ROOM CHANGES

705
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,000
WHEN THE DETECTIVES BRING UP
THE CASES OF THE FOUR

706
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,437
MISSING WOMEN - LISA
STASI, PAULA GODFREY,

707
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,074
CATHERINE CLAMPITT
AND SUZETTE TROUTEN.

708
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,843
(Dan) WHEN THOSE NAMES WERE
MENTIONED YOU COULD TELL

709
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:42,313
THAT JOHN ROBINSON KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT WAS COMING

710
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:46,284
HIS WAY. HE LOST THE
COLORATION IN HIS FACE.

711
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,920
HE APPEARED TO
BE SPEECHLESS

712
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,291
AND HE HAD A LOOK OF GREAT
CONCERN ON HIS FACE.

713
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,927
ROBINSON IS HANDCUFFED
AND TAKEN TO THE STATION.

714
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,729
HOPING TO GET A CONFESSION,
POLICE PLACE HIM IN

715
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,099
AN INTERROGATION ROOM
FILLED WITH PHOTOS

716
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,868
RELATED TO THEIR
INVESTIGATION.

717
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,337
(David) THE, THE ROOM WAS
SET UP IN THE MANNER

718
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,740
THAT EVERYWHERE YOU LOOKED,
YOU SAW JOHN ROBINSON'S

719
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,944
LIFE RIGHT THERE, YOU KNOW,
AS WE KNEW IT FROM

720
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,146
OUR CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION.

721
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,116
HE WOULD KNOW
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT,

722
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,219
BEYOND ANY DOUBT AT ALL,
THAT THE GIG WAS UP,

723
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,321
THAT HE'S, YOU
KNOW, HE'S HAD,

724
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,423
THAT THERE WERE
NO SECRETS.

725
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,494
AFTER TAKING IT ALL IN,
ROBINSON ASKS FOR A LAWYER.

726
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,630
WITHOUT A CONFESSION,

727
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,166
POLICE NEED TO TURN UP
CONCRETE EVIDENCE

728
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,603
ON ROBINSON'S PROPERTIES.
THE TRUTH, IT TURNS OUT,

729
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,772
IS FAR WORSE THEN
THEY EVER IMAGINED.

730
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,341
(♪)

731
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,510
(Narrator)
JUNE 1, 2000.

732
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,879
POLICE IN KANSAS HAVE
ARRESTED LOCAL RESIDENT

733
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,514
JOHN ROBINSON.

734
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,716
ALTHOUGH HE DENIES
ANY WRONGDOING,

735
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,784
HE IS THE PRIME SUSPECT
IN THE DISAPPEARANCE

736
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,987
OF SUZETTE TROUTEN
AND THREE WOMEN

737
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,722
FROM THE 1980s.

738
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,157
HOPING TO FINALLY
GET THE ANSWERS

739
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,558
THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,

740
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,261
POLICE EXECUTE SEARCH
WARRANTS ON HIS PROPERTIES,

741
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,163
STARTING WITH THE MOBILE
HOME HE LIVES IN

742
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,198
WITH HIS WIFE.

743
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,666
(camera shutter click)

744
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,536
HE DID USE SEVERAL
IDENTITIES WHEN HE WAS

745
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,472
SPEAKING TO THESE WOMEN. IN
FACT, WE FOUND PAPERWORK

746
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:18,543
IN HIS RESIDENCE TO SHOW
THAT HE WAS PORTRAYING

747
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,013
PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH
THE D.E.A., C.I.A.

748
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,683
AND HE HAD PAPERWORK WHERE
HE COULD PHOTOCOPY

749
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,120
AND TYPE UP HIS NAME AND,
AND MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE

750
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,557
THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY PART
OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS.

751
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,926
OTHER DETAILS OF
ROBINSON'S SECRET LIFE

752
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,661
TURN UP IN THE STORAGE
LOCKER HE KEEPS

753
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,296
IN AN ADJACENT CITY.

754
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,932
INSIDE, POLICE FIND
THE BLACK DUFFLE BAG

755
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,234
HE OFTEN CARRIED
AROUND WITH HIM.

756
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,336
WHILE IT HOLDS
NOTHING BUT SEX TOYS,

757
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,507
OTHER NEARBY CASES ARE
FAR MORE INCRIMINATING.

758
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,708
(camera shutter click)

759
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,245
WE FOUND IN
THAT STORAGE LOCKER

760
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,847
LITERALLY A TREASURE
TROVE OF EVIDENCE.

761
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,051
SOME OF MISSING SUZETTE
TROUTEN'S PERSONAL EFFECTS

762
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,620
TURN UP,
INCLUDING HER I.D.

763
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,523
POLICE ALSO FIND ENVELOPES
ADDRESSED TO HER FAMILY

764
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,058
AND SHEETS OF PAPER,

765
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,694
BLANK EXCEPT FOR
SUZETTE'S SIGNATURE,

766
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,862
PRE-SIGNED AT THE BOTTOM.

767
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,332
EVEN MORE DISTURBING,
POLICE FIND I.D.

768
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,701
BELONGING TO OTHER WOMEN,
CURRENTLY UNKNOWN

769
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,736
TO THE INVESTIGATION.

770
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,871
ALTHOUGH POLICE NOW HAVE
HARD EVIDENCE CONNECTING

771
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:23,341
JOHN ROBINSON TO
SUZETTE'S POSSESSIONS,

772
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:26,244
THEY STILL HAVE NO IDEA
OF HER WHEREABOUTS.

773
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,879
THE FOLLOWING DAY, A LARGE
TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS

774
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,183
MOVES IN ON HIS
RURAL FARM.

775
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,351
(camera shutter click)

776
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,388
WE HAD A SEARCH
WARRANT FOR THE PROPERTY.

777
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:41,659
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD SIZE
FORCE OF DETECTIVES THERE.

778
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,829
WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY ACROSS
THIS PROPERTY USING SEARCH

779
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,732
PATTERNS LOOKING FOR BODIES.

780
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:51,469
(Dan) I WAS IN CHARGE
OF FILMING THE SITE,

781
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,572
VIDEOTAPING THE PROCESS.

782
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,941
THE TERRAIN WAS
KIND OF HILLY.

783
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,277
SO IT TOOK US
QUITE AWHILE.

784
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,846
(Brad) WE LOOKED ALL
THROUGH THIS PROPERTY,

785
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,115
WE WERE JUST COMBING
ACROSS THE PROPERTY

786
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,918
AND SERGEANT ROTH HAD
DISCOVERED THESE BARRELS.

787
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,153
(camera shutter click)

788
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,690
SERGEANT ROTH
ROLLED THE FIRST ONE OUT

789
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,761
AND WHEN WE STOOD IT BACK -
I CAN REMEMBER TO THIS DAY -

790
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,031
THERE WAS A, A THIN
LINE OF, OF RED THAT,

791
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,533
THAT RAN DOWN
FROM THE, THE LIP.

792
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,436
(Brad) FLIES FROM NOWHERE
JUST APPEARED AND LANDED

793
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,806
ON THIS RED LIQUID. YOU
KNOW, WE CLEARLY KNEW

794
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,309
THEN THAT WE HAD
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT

795
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,244
IN THAT BARREL.

796
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,313
AN OFFICER FROM THE CRIME
LAB IS CALLED OVER

797
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,148
TO REMOVE THE LID.

798
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:41,952
INSIDE, POLICE FIND
DECOMPOSING HUMAN REMAINS.

799
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,988
(Brad) AND WE ALL JUST KIND
OF STOOD THERE FOR A MINUTE.

800
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,423
YOU KNOW IT WAS
KIND OF A SHOCK.

801
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,891
WE THINK THAT'S HER.

802
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,059
BUT IT'S SOMEONE.

803
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,328
IT'S A DEAD BODY
WE KNOW THAT.

804
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,697
WHETHER IT'S SUZETTE OR
NOT - WE DIDN'T KNOW,

805
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:57,735
BUT WE CLEARLY KNEW
THEN, THIS IS, WE'RE ON -

806
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,737
THIS IS IT.

807
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,540
MOMENTS LATER, POLICE
FIND ANOTHER BODY INSIDE

808
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,546
A SECOND BARREL.
TWO DAYS LATER,

809
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,981
AT JOHN ROBINSON'S STORAGE
LOCKER IN MISSOURI,

810
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,450
ACROSS
THE STATE LINE,

811
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,485
ANOTHER THREE BODIES
ARE RECOVERED,

812
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,188
ALSO SEALED UP IN BARRELS.

813
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,590
NEWS OF THE GRIM DISCOVERIES
SPREADS QUICKLY

814
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,492
TO THE LOCAL MEDIA.

815
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:22,860
(camera shutter click)

816
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:27,365
(Gerald) THERE WAS A LOT OF
GOSSIP AMONG THE MEDIA AND,

817
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,734
AND THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENTS.

818
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,370
THIS IS, THIS IS GETTING
BIGGER AND BIGGER EACH,

819
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,873
EACH DAY. BUT WHEN THEY
WENT TO THE SCENE,

820
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,376
AND BASICALLY
FOUND THE BARRELS,

821
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,379
I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT A
MEDIA FRENZY, IT WAS THERE.

822
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:46,016
I MEAN, NO ONE EXPECTED
BODIES ROTTING IN BARRELS.

823
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,619
THEN YOU GO ACROSS THE STATE
LINE YOU FIND THREE MORE,

824
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,390
THEN IT'S YOU KNOW THEY
HERE IN KANSAS CITY JOHNSON

825
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,527
COUNTY, THIS IS HAPPENING?

826
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,497
OVER THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS

827
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,333
FORENSIC EXPERTS COMPILE
FURTHER EVIDENCE

828
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,136
TYING JOHN ROBINSON
TO THE CRIME SCENES.

829
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,437
(camera shutter click)

830
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,874
I ACTUALLY SPENT FOUR
DAYS AT THE CRIME SCENE

831
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,076
AND MY PRIMARY ROLE
WAS TO PROCESS THE CRIME

832
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,512
SCENE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT
OF LATENT PRINTS.

833
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,515
THERE WERE A TOTAL OF ELEVEN
LATENT PRINT CARDS THAT WERE

834
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,251
LIFTED AT THE SCENE, ALL
THE LATENTS OF VALUE DID

835
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,621
IDENTIFY TO JOHN ROBINSON.

836
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,624
AT THE SAME TIME, DENTAL
RECORDS HELP PUT NAMES

837
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,427
ON THE VICTIMS. ONE
OF THE WOMEN FOUND

838
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,096
ON JOHN ROBINSON'S
FARM IS POSITIVELY

839
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,366
IDENTIFIED AS
MISSING SUZETTE TROUTEN.

840
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,436
THE OTHER IS CONFIRMED TO
BE ONE IZABELA LEWICKA,

841
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:43,207
A 21-YEAR-OLD FROM INDIANA
WHO WAS LAST SEEN IN 1999.

842
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,177
THE THREE BODIES IN MISSOURI
ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEVERLY

843
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,113
BONNER, SHEILA FAITH, AND
SHEILA'S DAUGHTER DEBBIE

844
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,082
FAITH, NONE OF WHOM WERE
EVER REPORTED MISSING

845
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,385
OR ASSOCIATED IN THE
EARLIER INVESTIGATION

846
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,087
INTO JOHN ROBINSON.

847
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,657
(Paul) ONE OF HIS PATTERNS
WAS TO PICK UP WOMEN

848
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,959
AND HOOK UP WITH WOMEN
THAT IN MANY,

849
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,661
MANY WAYS WERE DESPERATE.

850
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,931
HE GOT HIS HOOKS IN THEM BY
BASICALLY PROMISING THEM

851
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,566
THAT HE WAS GONNA
HELP THEM MAKE IT,

852
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,834
HE WAS GONNA GET
'EM A GOOD JOB,

853
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,302
HE WAS GONNA GET
THEM JOB TRAINING,

854
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,037
THAT KIND OF A THING.

855
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,673
AND, UM, THEY WOULD TELL
FRIENDS TYPICALLY OR FAMILY

856
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,409
THAT THEY WERE GETTING
READY TO GO OUT OF TOWN,

857
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,245
THEY'D NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN.

858
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,681
(David) HE WOULD CONVINCE
THEM TO SIGN BLANK LETTERS.

859
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,051
SO THEY DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAD

860
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,220
GOING IN HIS MIND.

861
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,955
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
THEY WERE YOU KNOW,

862
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,590
HELPING HIM MAKE
THEM DISAPPEAR.

863
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,792
BUT THAT IS WHAT
THEY WERE DOING.

864
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,328
WHILE THE BODIES OF MISSING
WOMEN CATHERINE CLAMPITT,

865
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,865
PAULA GODFREY AND LISA STASI
DON'T TURN UP IN SEARCHES

866
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,133
OF ROBINSON'S PROPERTY,
FURTHER INVESTIGATION

867
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,336
MAKES A STARTLING
DISCOVERY.

868
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,806
JOHN ROBINSON'S OWN BROTHER
ADOPTED LISA STASI'S

869
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,242
DAUGHTER TIFFANY,
ONLY FIVE MONTHS OLD

870
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,444
WHEN SHE WENT MISSING
WITH HER MOTHER.

871
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,280
BY FORGING ADOPTION PAPERS
AND CHARGING HIS BROTHER

872
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,382
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR
WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS

873
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,985
A LEGITIMATE ADOPTION,
ROBINSON MAY HAVE BEEN

874
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,387
MOTIVATED BY NOTHING
MORE THAN THE CHANCE

875
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,190
OF MAKING A SMALL PROFIT.

876
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,993
(Paul) THERE ARE
PICTURES THAT EVENING

877
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,828
AND JOHN ROBINSON'S SITTING
THERE WITH THE FAMILY

878
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,398
BOUNCING LISA STASI'S
YOUNG BABY ON HIS KNEE,

879
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,735
GRINNING LIKE A CHESHIRE
CAT IN THERE AND WE ALWAYS

880
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,539
THEORIZED THAT THAT WAS
PROBABLY JUST LITERALLY

881
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,775
HOURS AFTER HE HAD
KILLED LISA STASI,

882
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,211
THAT BABY'S MOTHER.

883
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:32,483
(Paul) PEOPLE LIKE
ROBINSON ARE SOCIOPATHS:

884
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:38,289
SOMEBODY WHO REALLY LACKS THE
CAPACITY TO FEEL REAL EMOTION.

885
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,559
AND HE LITERALLY WAS
LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE.

886
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,761
YOU KNOW, ON THE ONE
HAND HE WAS A HUSBAND

887
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,398
AND A GRANDFATHER AND ON
THE OTHER HAND HE WAS A,

888
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,401
A SERIAL KILLER.

889
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,436
(Brad) I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MAKES A GUY LIKE THAT TICK.

890
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:58,709
WHY HE DID THE EVIL
THINGS THAT HE DID?

891
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,210
HE JUST DEVELOPED
INTO THIS PERSON

892
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:04,515
THAT COULD KILL PEOPLE
WITHOUT REMORSE.

893
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,151
IN OCTOBER OF 2002,

894
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,820
JOHN ROBINSON STANDS
TRIAL IN KANSAS,

895
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,722
CHARGED WITH CAPITAL
MURDER IN THE CASES

896
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,692
OF SUZETTE TROUTEN
AND IZABELA LEWICKA.

897
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,994
HE IS ALSO CHARGED WITH
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER

898
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,831
IN THE CASE OF LISA STASI,
WHOSE BODY WAS NEVER FOUND.

899
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,334
OUTSTANDING CHARGES IN
MISSOURI INVOLVE THE MURDERS

900
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,737
OF BEVERLY BONNER, AND
SHEILA AND DEBBIE FAITH.

901
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,740
WITH ROBINSON DUBBED THE
WORLD'S FIRST CYBER-KILLER,

902
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,810
AND OFTEN REFERRED TO AS
SLAVE MASTER IN THE PRESS,

903
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,614
THE ENTIRE STATE IS GRIPPED
BY THE PROCEEDINGS.

904
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,351
(Gerald) YOU KNOW, JOHNSON
COUNTY AT MOST MAYBE HAVE

905
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,853
LIKE ONE OR TWO
MURDERS A YEAR.

906
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,989
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE
THIS WHERE BODIES

907
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,724
ARE BEING IN BARRELS.

908
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,927
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN
OUR NECK OF THE WOODS.

909
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,997
FACING A MOUNTAIN
OF EVIDENCE,

910
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:56,200
ROBINSON IS EVENTUALLY FOUND
GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES

911
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,836
AND SENTENCED TO DEATH.

912
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,938
ALTHOUGH THE BODIES
OF LISA STASI,

913
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:04,108
CATHERINE CLAMPITT AND PAULA
GODFREY WERE NEVER LOCATED,

914
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,477
THE FACT THAT ROBINSON WILL
PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE FOR

915
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,114
HIS CRIMES PROVIDES AT LEAST
SOME COMFORT TO THE FAMILIES

916
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,750
OF THE MANY VICTIMS.

917
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,485
(Dan) I FELT RELIEVED.

918
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,520
THAT ALL THE WORK THAT
WE HAD WENT THROUGH,

919
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,422
THAT IT CAME DOWN TO THAT.

920
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:22,292
RELIEVED FOR THE FAMILIES,
KNOWING THAT THEY COULD GAIN

921
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,662
SOME SORT OF CLOSURE.

922
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:28,399
TODAY, JOHN ROBINSON REMAINS
ON DEATH ROW IN KANSAS,

923
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,234
AWAITING HIS PUNISHMENT.

924
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,670
SADLY, THE LEGACY OF
HIS LIFE OF VIOLENCE

925
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,340
WILL LIVE ON LONG
AFTER HE IS GONE.

926
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,675
(camera shutter click)

927
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,978
(Stephen) THE NUMBER OF
LIVES THAT, YOU KNOW,

928
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:46,250
ROBINSON HAS DESTROYED
IS, IS UNBELIEVABLE.

929
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,053
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THE
VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES,

930
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,523
HE'S IMPACTED HUNDREDS OF
OTHER PEOPLE JUST BY HIS,

931
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,694
HIS THEFTS AND
CRIMES AND LIES.

932
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,698
(Paul) I THINK THE MORAL
OF THE STORY IS HOW

933
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,001
DANGEROUS THE
INTERNET CAN BE.

934
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,636
THE INTERNET BRINGS US
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS,

935
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,839
BUT THERE IS A DEFINITE
DARK SIDE TO THAT,

936
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,108
THAT EXHIBITED ITSELF IN
THIS CASE BY WHAT HAPPENED

937
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,010
TO THESE WOMEN.

938
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,713
AND GUYS LIKE JOHN ROBINSON
THAT SORTA COME OUT OF

939
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,649
NOWHERE AND PROMISE
THE WORLD TO PEOPLE,

940
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:22,720
THERE'S AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE
AND OFTEN TIMES THERE'S

941
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,022
A REAL DARK SIDE TO
WHAT'S GOING ON,

942
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,559
AND HE WAS AN EXPERT AT
OFFERING HOPE TO THE HOPELESS.

943
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,195
AND LURED 'EM IN JUST LIKE
A SPIDER INTO, YOU KNOW,

944
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,732
LURING A MOTH TO A WEB
AND ONCE THEY GOT HERE,

945
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,835
FOR A LOT OF THEM,
THAT WAS THE END.

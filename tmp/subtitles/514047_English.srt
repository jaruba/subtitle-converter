1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,729
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,589
(emotionally stirring music)

3
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,778
(men yelling)

4
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,441
(dramatic music)

5
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:08,148
(hand grenade exploding)

6
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:13,972
(men yelling)

7
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:20,265
(hand grenade exploding)

8
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:26,474
(men yelling)

9
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:33,426
(regal dramatic music)

10
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,436
Your Holiness, thieves
have stolen our God Mara,

11
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,626
what shall we do?

12
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,636
Journey south to Wingpoo at once

13
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,646
and give this message to the Governor.

14
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,816
The God Mara and the thieves who stole it,

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,046
must be delivered to me,
or I will destroy Wingpoo

16
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,316
and everyone in it.

17
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,006
But what of your long-standing treaty

18
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,026
with the villagers of Wingpoo,

19
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,416
that no harm shall come to the settlement.

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,206
Shall I break the word
of the great Dragon Lady.

21
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,276
You have your orders, do as you're told.

22
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,363
Yes, Your Holiness.

23
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,686
(dramatic music)

24
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,116
You are the great Governor,
I am the High Priest.

25
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,926
It is urgent that we talk.

26
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,406
All right, you're
here, so start talking.

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,816
I bring terrible bad news.

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,106
Our great God Mara has been stolen.

29
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,470
Oh, that is bad news,
how do, you don't suppose...

30
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:23,936
I tell you it was stolen.

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,196
The God Mara and the two white
thieves must be returned,

32
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,606
so that justice may be served.

33
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,596
What, two white thieves?

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,286
I know what he's talkin' about.

35
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,506
Those two suspicious
characters looking for Dr. Lee.

36
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,936
All right, all right, I'll look into it.

37
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,586
And next time, I'll hear
more of this fine story.

38
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,306
You must catch these
thieves in three days,

39
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,276
if you want to save Wingpoo,

40
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,193
or the Dragon Lady will destroy you all.

41
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,906
Now the way I see
it, it's something were

42
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,066
to happen to the village.

43
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,900
Why?

44
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,836
You'd be the first person they'd blame.

45
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,438
You're the Governor,
you should do something.

46
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,686
You know, you're right.

47
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,979
I should go for the village tonight.

48
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:09,008
(dramatic music)

49
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,716
(men yelling)

50
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,133
Gee Pat, must be some
sort of a festival.

51
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,886
Everybody sure looks happy tonight.

52
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,646
Come on, let's have some fun.

53
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,036
Men, your homes are in danger.

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,436
The jungle people will attack,

55
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,606
unless we destroy the thieves
that stole their God Mara.

56
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,671
Are you with me?

57
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,246
(men yelling)

58
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,250
He sure knows how to rattle 'em.

59
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,176
Go tell Stanton.

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,986
These two outsiders threaten
the safety of your family

61
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,160
and neighbors, will you let that happen?

62
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,526
(men yelling)

63
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,360
Hey, he could cause a lot of trouble.

64
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:46,346
Men, thieves are
already on their way here.

65
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,587
And when they come...

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Men, look.

67
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,321
After them.

68
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:53,936
(men yelling)

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,374
Gosh Terry, they're
after us, come on let's go.

70
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,148
(dramatic music)

71
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,106
Now all we have to do, is
wait 'til they're finished.

72
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,393
I suppose we should go.

73
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:20,676
Governor, the acts of
this crowd are barbaric.

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,376
You should do something.

75
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,936
Why, why should those
two little old lie,

76
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,756
although now I'm sure you can see

77
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,956
for yourself why they
must be sent on home.

78
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,226
Wan, go into town and
find the police chief,

79
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,076
tell him to find out who's responsible

80
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,433
for these shenanigans and lock 'em up.

81
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:44,296
(men yelling)

82
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,626
(gun firing)

83
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,460
[Mr. Drake] Unhand those men.

84
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,526
If they're guilty, they
should stand trial.

85
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,867
Get out of here, nobody want
to hear what you have to say.

86
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,391
(men yelling)

87
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,036
[Mr. Drake] Unhand me, let me go!

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,510
You have no right to do this.

89
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,960
Unhand me, I tell you.

90
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,813
You'll never get away with this.

91
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:05,156
I'll ring the American
Consulate finds out,

92
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
he'll send repres...

93
00:06:12,011 --> 00:06:13,876
(men yelling)

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,016
Wait a minute, you can't
go out there with a weapon,

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,666
someone will get shot.

96
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,806
Better give me that.

97
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,566
He's right you know,
somebody will get hurt.

98
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,400
Yeah.

99
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,875
Oh for Pete's sakes.

100
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,155
(dramatic music)

101
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:26,679
(men yelling)

102
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,326
The boys?

103
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,817
We can't help them.

104
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,832
Are they guilty?

105
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,216
[All] Yes.

106
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,520
Then the law says, you must die.

107
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,910
(gun firing)

108
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:44,934
Look!

109
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:51,641
(gun firing)

110
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,566
Senor Stanton, it's no good.

111
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,266
Somebody tip off police,
now they go to jail.

112
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,836
We still got those box of bombs.

113
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,091
Miguel's right, it's worth a try.

114
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,426
All I know is, bombs better cinch it

115
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,876
because fire didn't.

116
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,506
Hold it Captain, you make mistake.

117
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,676
These are our friends.

118
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,510
Are you kidding,

119
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,976
I've never seen these
guys before in my life.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,810
Have you Terry?

121
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,796
No, never before now.

122
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,574
Come on, let's get started.

123
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,348
(dramatic music)

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,827
Ow!

125
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,768
Inside, inside, inside.

126
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,480
Hi boss.

127
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,896
We here to help.

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,306
I appreciate the sentiment Connie,

129
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,875
but frankly you'd be more
help if you were outside.

130
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:59,728
(men yelling)

131
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:00,562
All right, let's show 'em,

132
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,673
or the whole village will be wiped out.

133
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:06,466
These men are responsible
for endangering your families

134
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,377
and your homes.

135
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,182
They must be punished or
Wingpoo will be destroyed.

136
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:13,066
(men yelling)

137
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,940
Listen, there's only
one thing left to do

138
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,440
and that's burn down the jail.

139
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:20,678
(men yelling)

140
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:21,702
See, let's go.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,433
Gosh Pat, looks like
the whole town's outside.

142
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,636
(men yelling)

143
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,730
Start diggin', right there.

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,696
[Henchman] The dynamite's
in place, Mr. Stanton.

145
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Okay, light it.

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,493
Get that window open.

147
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Hurry!

148
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,466
(building exploding)

149
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,496
Well, that settles it.

150
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,243
Now we can go finish our plans.

151
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,516
You two stand guard out here.

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,990
Remember, keep your guard up.

153
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,373
You stand guard first, me do.

154
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,726
I'm sure glad to see you alive.

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,266
I'm afraid, I wasn't much help.

156
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,576
You did more than enough.

157
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,409
Thanks for everything.

158
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,433
Sit down.

159
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,246
Now what happened?

160
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,080
We were ambushed.

161
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:58,206
Chased us, all the
way down to the river.

162
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,427
And Pat and I swam...

163
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:00,496
Just a moment.

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,113
Dow, that will be all.

165
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,056
He might be one of them.

166
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,216
Now, go ahead.

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,050
Anyway...

168
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,276
Hold it Terry.

169
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,496
You know, we explained to those people,

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,646
we were just scientists.

171
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,726
The problem is, why were
they trying to kill us?

172
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,506
I think I know.

173
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,716
A statue of some kind,

174
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,376
might have been stolen from
the Dragon Lady's temple.

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,156
They think you're responsible.

176
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,646
Well that's it then.

177
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,876
We were there, when the real
thieves made away with it.

178
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,276
But we had nothing to do with the plan.

179
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,846
However, the villagers now believe

180
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,606
that you are the ones who are to blame.

181
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,996
Maybe Fang's men stole it.

182
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,516
I bet I know where it is,
same place he took Normandie.

183
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,786
Let's just go to the temple and
tell her that's where it is.

184
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,706
You're right, it's worth a try.

185
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,016
Whatever you want.

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,616
I want to help you with
everything, is there any way I can?

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,547
I don't know.

188
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:45,936
That would be putting you and
your daughter in great danger.

189
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,896
Would it be asking too much for a shower?

190
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,729
Of course not.

191
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:49,562
Make yourselves at home.

192
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:50,395
- Please.
- Thanks.

193
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,419
Come on Terry.

194
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,637
He said, "Keep up your guard."

195
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,603
You no worry, I keep
it with me, I worry.

196
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,630
Take this away.

197
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,116
Well, better get going.

198
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,016
Better take my pistol.

199
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,849
Smart.

200
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:11,786
And a couple of rifles.

201
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,620
I'll get them.

202
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:13,656
Thanks for everything Mr. Drake.

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,577
You're quite welcome, my boy.

204
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,786
Thanks for the use of your camera.

205
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,706
[Mr. Drake] I hope to
get it back in one piece.

206
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,216
Watch out for Fang's men.

207
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,050
That'll be swell.

208
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:21,410
I'll be back in a minute.

209
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,696
Goodbye boys, you should be careful.

210
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,853
Are you safe here?

211
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:30,687
I'm sure we are.

212
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:31,913
All right then, come on.

213
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:37,311
(ominous music)

214
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,666
Two white man, looking
for Fangs hideout,

215
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,933
seek location of Mara, send message.

216
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,268
(drums beating)

217
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,136
Stop, what do you think you're doing?

218
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,326
You're one of Fang's men.

219
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,834
You'll get it when my
father finds out about this.

220
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:01,608
(dramatic music)

221
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:09,631
(drums beating)

222
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,466
(drums beating)

223
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,516
Message all right.

224
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,874
Me go back to house,
before Master Drake find out.

225
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,648
(dramatic music)

226
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,586
Master Fang, Master Fang.

227
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,566
Message from Wingpoo,
saying two white men gone,

228
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,556
know all about statue.

229
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,876
Two men gone to Dragon Lady's temple.

230
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,216
The fools.

231
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,676
Stanton has failed.

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,746
They must be stopped, await my orders.

233
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,926
Now go!

234
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,876
Dr. Lee, it seems our
conversation has been cut short,

235
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,226
due to outside affairs.

236
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,646
However, we shall talk again.

237
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,670
Take him away.

238
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,876
Go into the jungle, find these men,

239
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,036
before they reach the Temple of the Dawn.

240
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,116
Remember, they must be
stopped at all costs.

241
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,986
Yes, Master Fang.

242
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,566
Ambo and I shall do your bidding.

243
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,097
See that you do, now hurry, hurry.

244
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,464
Ambo!

245
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,718
(gorilla growling)

246
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,356
Ambo, come!

247
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:33,626
(crickets chirping)

248
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,400
(dramatic music)

249
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,380
(thumping)

250
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,363
(snoring)

251
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,056
Normandie, where have you been?

252
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,156
I was worried about you.

253
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,246
Oh, I'm sorry dad, but
I was suspicious of Dow,

254
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,080
so I followed him.

255
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,696
I heard drums, what was that?

256
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,436
A message to Fang, telling
him all about our plans.

257
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,996
It's been hours, they're far away

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,746
but we have to try and warn them.

259
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,033
We have to do something.

260
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,406
There's only one choice, I have to,

261
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,113
oh, oh my shoulder.

262
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,476
You're too weak to be of any help.

263
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,116
I'll go myself.

264
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,676
[Mr. Drake] Normandy,
Fangs men are dangerous.

265
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,366
You could be killed, you
don't have to do this.

266
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,956
I'll be all right, you know
I can take care of myself.

267
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,030
See you at breakfast.

268
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,416
(dramatic music)

269
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,470
(tiger growling)

270
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,416
(tiger growling)

271
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,802
(rifle shooting)

272
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,986
(tiger growling)

273
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,586
That gunshot was mighty close by.

274
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,143
Maybe I should see who it was?

275
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,917
No, somebody might be
following, we better get going.

276
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,157
(gorilla growling)

277
00:15:54,893 --> 00:15:56,256
(gorilla growling)

278
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,613
(screaming)

279
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,558
(screaming)

280
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,883
Ambo, Ambo.

281
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,760
(speaking foreign language)

282
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,386
(screaming)

283
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,696
[Narrator] Sinister Fang
threatens to torture Dr. Lee,

284
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,366
if he doesn't decipher
the ancient scrolls,

285
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,186
revealing hidden
treasures of the God Mara.

286
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,476
Pat and Terry are captured
and taken to Fang's hideout.

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,096
Fang threatens to torture Terry and Pat,

288
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,436
if Dr. Lee doesn't cooperate.

289
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,666
When suddenly a fight breaks out

290
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,226
that will decide their fate.

291
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,106
These are just some of
the spine-tingling thrills

292
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,146
that await in "The Scroll of Wealth".

293
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,457
The next exciting chapter
of "Terry and the Pirates".

294
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,523
(dramatic music)

00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:29,062
WOW.

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:33,066
AT LEAST WE KNOW THEY HAVE
TECHNOLOGY

4
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,037
IN THIS WORLD. LET'S SEE IF WE
CAN BUY SOME REPLACEMENT
MIRRORS.

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,074
WHAT IF SOMEONE FINDS THE BOAT?

6
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:45,078
NO ONE CAN USE IT NOW.

7
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,086
DO WE HAVE TO FIND MIRRORS?

8
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:57,090
WON'T SOMETHING ELSE DO? THE
MIRRORS THAT ELVO SMASHED ALIGN
THE SYSTEMS

9
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,094
THAT GUIDE THE BOAT. IF WE
CAN'T REPLACE THEM, WE'LL HAVE
NO CONTROL OVER OUR DESTINATION

10
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,098
AND WE'LL NEVER GET HOME?
WE'LL GET HOME.

11
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:13,139
(CLATTER)

12
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,143
IS THIS ANY USE?

13
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,151
NO. BUT IT'S A GOOD SIGN. THEY
HAVE GLASS HERE.

14
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:29,155
THEY PROBABLY HAVE MIRRORS TOO.

15
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,213
MEK! OVER HERE!

16
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:05,225
WHAT IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.

17
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:09,262
SOME KIND OF VEHICLE?

18
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,233
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WAY
IN.

19
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,274

IT'S RUSTED.

22
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,298
SHH. PRINCESS AYA,

23
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,335
I'VE HAD YOUR ADVISOR DRAW UP A
PROCLAMATION.

24
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,339
IT PROCLAIMS ME THE NEW DRAGON
LORD.

25
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,343
SIGN IT. ONLY MEMBERS OF MY
FAMILY

26
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,347
CAN BECOME DRAGON LORDS. THEN
YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE ME

27
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,351
A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.
YOU'RE MAD.

28
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,355
THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK TO YOUR
FUTURE HUSBAND.

29
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,359
WE WILL HAVE A ROYAL WEDDING.
EVERYONE LOVES A WEDDING.

30
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,363
I WILL NEVER MARRY YOU.
REMEMBER THAT YOUR BROTHER

31
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,401
IS MY PRISONER. I WILL GIVE YOU
SOME TIME

32
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,405
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. TAKE HER
AWAY.

33
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,413
(INDISTINCT) THE PEOPLE WILL
HAVE

34
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,417
TO ACCEPT HIM AS THE DRAGON
LORD.

35
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,421
CONSULT THE DIVINER AND DECIDE
THE BEST TIME FOR MY WEDDING.

36
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,425
AND CLEAN THE PALACE OF
SPIRITS. THERE ARE EVIL FORCES
PRESENT.

37
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,429
I CAN FEEL THEM WATCHING.

38
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,437
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND
ANY FRIENDLY GHOSTS?

39
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:17,490
ANCESTORS, TELL ME HOW TO STOP
SHARAK FROM MARRYING MY SISTER.

40
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,527
SUN, I DON'T THINK THEY CAN
HEAR YOU. (CLASH OF SWORD BLADE)

41
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,531
THEN I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN!
SUN, NO!

42
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,535
SUN!

43
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:33,539
SUN! DON'T BE AN IDIOT!

44

47
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:53,559
SHARAK'S ARMY? I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING. (THINGS CRASH TO

THEY'RE FIREWORKS! WHAT, ARE
YOU TRYING

49
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,601
TO BLOW US UP?

50
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:05,571

MIRRORS.

LET ME SEE. MEK, DON'T --
(CRACK)

61
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:23,683
WHAT HAPPENED?

62
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,687
YOU GOT AN ELECTRIC SHOCK. IT
BURNT ME. ELECTRICITY CREATES
HEAT.

63
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,657
THAT'S HOW WE HEAT OUR HOMES
AND BOIL OUR WATER.

00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,661
WOULD A MACHINE THIS BIG
CREATE A LOT OF ELECTRICITY?

I GUESS SO. WHY?

66
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,703
IF I CAN REPAIR IT, I MIGHT BE
ABLE

67
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,707
TO GENERATE ENOUGH HEAT TO FUSE
THE BROKEN MIRRORS IN THE BOAT.

HERE.

SHARAK'S PLANNING TO MARRY HER.
SO HE CAN LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE.

00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,399
SHARAK'S COMING. GET OUT.

154
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,456
KATHY --

155
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,460
THESE ARE FOR YOUR FRIEND.
THANK YOU, JEZ.

156
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,464
HOW LONG WERE YOU UNDERGROUND?
WE CAME UP NEARLY FOUR YEARS
AGO.

157
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,501
YOU LIVED UNDERGROUND? I WAS
BORN THERE.

158
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,472
BUT I'M NEVER GOING BACK. ARE
YOU THE ONLY PEOPLE AROUND HERE?

159
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,509
UNTIL YOU ARRIVED, WE THOUGHT
WE WERE THE ONLY SURVIVORS IN
THE WHOLE WORLD.

160
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,513
SURVIVORS OF WHAT? ELIN, ELIN.

161
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:25,517
WE FOUND ANOTHER ONE. EXCUSE
ME, KATHY.

162
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,488
WHAT HAVE THEY FOUND? COME
AND SEE.

163
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,537
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS?

164
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,541
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF
MOTOR.

165
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,545
LIKE A CAR ENGINE. YOU KNOW
ABOUT MACHINES? TAKE IT TO THE
GRAVEYARD.

166
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,583
CHILDREN, THIS WAY. COME ON,
COME ON.

167
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,553
WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND REPAIR
IT?

168
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,591
NO. THE MACHINES MUST BE
DESTROYED. ALL OF THEM?

169
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,595
DON'T YOU PEOPLE DO THE SAME?
UH - -OF COURSE.

170
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,599
WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU COME FROM?

171
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,603
LOOK, I'D BETTER GO AND FIND
MY FRIEND MEK. HE CAN EXPLAIN

172
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:21,607
EVERYTHING TO YOU. GOOD. I
WILL PREPARE A BED FOR YOU. YOU
MUST BOTH

173
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,609
STAY WITH US. WE WILL HAVE A
GATHERING

174
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,644
TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE YOUR
ARRIVAL. GREAT.

175
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,648
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN. BYE. KATHY!

176
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,652
YOU FORGOT THIS. CAN I CARRY IT
FOR YOU?

177
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,759
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH
THAT MACHINE WHEN

178
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,761
THEY GET IT TO THE GRAVEYARD?
THIS IS THE GRAVEYARD.

179
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,763
DON'T YOU HAVE ONE WHERE YOU
COME FROM?

180
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,767
JEZ!

181
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,771
(CLANKING)

182
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,511
WHY DO YOU TRASH ALL THIS
STUFF? YOU COULD USE IT. IT
WOULD BE WRONG

183
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,515
TO USE MACHINES. WHY? BECAUSE
OF THE WAR, OF COURSE.

184
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,519
WAR? JEZ! I FOUND A NEW TYPE
OF MACHINE.

185
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,358
COME AND SEE! YOU GO. I'LL
FIND MEK AND MEET YOU BACK HERE.

186
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:19,531
MEK -- MEK!

187
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,539
I FOUND A VILLAGE. THE PEOPLE
ARE FRIENDLY. THEY GAVE ME
FOOD. DO THEY HAVE ANY MIRRORS?

188
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,543
NO. NEVER MIND. COME AND SEE
WHAT I'VE DONE.

189
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,555
THIS PLACE IS WEIRD, MEK.

190
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,557
THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIVING
UNDERGROUND

191
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,559
FOR YEARS. AND THEY'RE
FRIGHTENED OF MACHINES.

192
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,597
WATCH THIS.

193
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,601
(LOUD RUMBLING SOUND)

194
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,605
IT'S A COMPUTER! A COMPUTER?
IT'S A BIT LIKE THE ORACLE.

195
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,609
IT STORES INFORMATION. MAYBE
IT CAN TELL US HOW TO START THE
MOTOR.

196
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:11,650
THERE'S NO KEYBOARD. KATHY,
HAND ME THAT TOOL.

197
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,625
PERHAPS WE SHOULD SHOW THIS
MACHINE TO ELIN. WHY?

198
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,662
SHE TOLD US TO DESTROY THEM
ALL. THAT SOUNDED LIKE JEZ.

199
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,666
MEK, LOOK!

200
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,670
I'VE SEEN THIS IN MOVIES. IT'S
USING SENSORS TO DETECT THE
KIDS OUTSIDE.

201
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,674
IT'S PICKING UP THE HEAT OF
THEIR BODIES. COME AND LOOK!

202
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,682
SEE? IT'S THE KIDS FROM THE
VILLAGE.

203
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,686
COME AND MEET THEM. I'LL JOIN
YOU SOON.

204
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,690
I JUST WANT TO FINISH THIS WORK.

205
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,698
(DRILLING SOUND)

206
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,739
(BEEPING)

207
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,747
JEZ, STOP! THAT'S OUR BOAT!

208
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,751
IT'S A MACHINE. ELIN SAYS THAT
ALL MACHINES MUST BE DESTROYED.

209
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,755
BUT IF YOU WRECK IT, WE CAN'T
GET HOME.

210
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,759
SORRY. WE THOUGHT IT CAME FROM
THE MOLLOCHS. MOLLOCHS?

211
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,763
WHAT'S A MOLLOCH? THAT THING.

212
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,801
THEY TURNED ON US IN THE WAR
AND TRIED

213
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,805
TO KILL ALL THE HUMANS. WHY
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

214
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,809
NO! KATHY,

215
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,813
I'VE FINISHED. MEK, WE'VE GOT
TO GET BACK INSIDE AND PULL OUT
THE WIRING. WHAT?

216
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,850
(LOUD MACHINE SOUNDS)

217
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,854
RUN, KATHY!

218
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,858
GET AWAY FROM THERE!

219
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,862
MEK, WE'VE GOT TO SHUT IT DOWN!

220
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,870
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
HAPPENED.

221
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,874
(BOOM!)

222
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,878
(BOOM!)

223
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:23,882
JEZ, LOOK OUT!

224
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,919
(BOOM!)

225
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,921
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. WE HAVE TO
GET BACK TO

226
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,923
THE BOAT AND GET OUT OF HERE.
THE CRYSTAL.

227
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:35,927
I LEFT IT INSIDE THE MACHINE.
WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT IT.

228
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,931
MEK, GET DOWN! (BOOM!)

229
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,935
MEK!!
